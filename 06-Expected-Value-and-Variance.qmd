#Introduce a raffle with 1/4 that win 10 buck and 3/4 win 0. What is expected value? What is variance?

#Lets make one grand prize ticket worth 10,000. 3/4 win 0, 249/1000 win 10 and 1/1000 win 10,000
```

-   There is one winning randomly selected ticket that will win the grand prize of \$5,000.
-   Two tickets will be randomly selected to win a second prize each worth \$1,000.
-   Ten tickets will be randomly selected to win a third prize each worth \$200.
-   The remaining tickets do not win a prize.

## Question 1

---

Let random variable $X$ be the amount of money won by a randomly selected raffle ticket. We let $p(x)$ denote the corresponding probability mass function of $X$.


### Question 1a

---

Fill in the values of $x$ and $p(x)$ in the table below.

#### Solution to Question 1a

**Fill in the blanks to complete the table.**

| $x$    | ??  | ??  | ??  | ??  |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| $p(x)$ | ??  | ??  | ??  | ??  |


<br>  
<br>  


### Question 1b

---

If somebody offered to buy a raffle ticket from you, what do you think fair value is for the ticket?


#### Solution to Question 1b

---


<br>  
<br>  
<br>  



### Question 1c

---

Consider another ticket raffle. There are 1,000 tickets with the following payouts:

- 500 randomly selected tickets will win a grand prize of \$15.
- The other 500 tickets do not win a prize.

Let random variable $Y$ be the amount of money won by a randomly selected raffle ticket.

Somebody offers one free ticket to either raffle $X$ or raffle $Y$ (but not both!), which would you prefer and why?


#### Solution to Question 1c

# The Expected Value of a Discrete Random Variable

---

The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**expected value**</span> for a discrete random variable $X$ is denoted $\color{dodgerblue}{E(X)}$. We compute

$$\color{dodgerblue}{E(X) = \mu_{X} =  \sum_x \left( x \cdot p(x) \right)}. $$


- $E(X)$ is the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**average** or **mean**</span> value of random variable $X$.
- The expected value of $X$ is denoted $\color{dodgerblue}{E(X)}$ or $\color{dodgerblue}{\mu_X}$.
- The expected value of $X$ might not be a possible value of $X$.


# The Variance of a Discrete Random Variable

---

The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**variance**</span> for a discrete random variable $X$ is one common way to measure how spread out (in relation to the expected value) are the values of $X$.  We compute

$$\color{dodgerblue}{\mbox{Var}(X) = \sigma_X^2 =  E\big( (x-\mu_X)^2 \big) = \sum_x \left( (x-\mu_X)^2 \cdot p(x) \right)}. $$

- $\mbox{Var}(X)$ is the expected value of the squared distance from the mean.
- The variance is denoted $\color{dodgerblue}{\mbox{Var}(X)}$ or $\color{dodgerblue}{\sigma_X^2}$.

# The Standard Deviation of a Discrete Random Variable

---

The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**standard deviation**</span> for a discrete random variable $X$ is the square root of the variance,

$$ \mbox{SD}(X) = \sigma_X  =  \sqrt{\mbox{Var}(X)}. $$


- The standard deviation of random variable $X$ is denoted $\color{dodgerblue}{\sigma_X}$.
- The standard deviation essentially measures the average distance of the values of $X$ from its mean $\mu_X$.
- The units of $\sigma_X$ and $X$ are the same, and thus standard deviation is often a practical way to describe the spread of $X$.

## Question 2

---

Using [properties of discrete random variables](#sec-propdis), show that for any discrete random variable $X$ with pmf $p(X)$ and expected value $E(X) = \mu$, we have

$$\mbox{Var}(X) = E(X^2)  - \mu^2.$$

### Solution to Question 2

---

**Finish the proof below!**

Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with pmf $p(x)$ and expected value $E(X)=\mu$. Then we have

$$\begin{array}{rcll}
\mbox{Var}(X) &=&  \sum_x \left( (x-\mu)^2 \cdot p(x) \right) & \mbox{(by definition)}\\
 &=& \sum_x \left( (x^2 -2 \mu x + \mu^2) \cdot p(x) \right) & \mbox{(distributing squared term)}\\
 &=& \sum_x \left( x^2 \cdot p(x) -2 \mu x  \cdot p(x)  + \mu^2  \cdot p(x)  \right) & \mbox{(distributing p(x))}\\
 &=& \sum_x \left( x^2 \cdot p(x) \right) - \sum_x \left(2 \mu x  \cdot p(x) \right)  + \sum_x \left( \mu^2  \cdot p(x)  \right) & \mbox{(properties of summation)}\\
 &=& ?? & \mbox{(??)} \\
 &=& ?? & \mbox{(??)} \\
 &=& ?? & \mbox{(??)} \\
 &=& ?? & \mbox{(??)} \\
\end{array}$$


\


Therefore, we see that $\mbox{Var}(X) = E(X^2)  - \mu^2$.

# Mean, Median, and Variance of Continuous Random Variables

---

Let $f(x)$ and $F(x)$ denote the probability density function and cumulative distribution function for a continuous random variable $X$.

-   The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**expected value**</span> or <span style="color:dodgerblue">**mean**</span> is

$$E(X) = \mu_X = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx.$$

-   The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**variance**</span> is 

$$\mbox{Var}(X) = E(X-\mu_X)^2 = E(X^2) - \mu_X^2.$$

-   The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**median**</span> is the value $x$ such that $P(X < x) = 0.5$. Thus, to find the median we solve the equations below for $x$,

$$\int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \, dt = 0.5 \qquad \mbox{or equivalently} \qquad F(x) =0.5.$$

## Question 4

---

Consider the random variable $X$ with pdf

$$ f_X(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
\frac{x}{8}, &  0 \leq x \leq 4 \\ 
0, &  \mbox{otherwise} 
\end{array} \right. .$$

$$F_X(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0 & x < 0\\
?? & 0 \leq x \leq 4 \\
1 & x > 4 
\end{array} \right.$$

# Properties of Expected Value {#sec-prop-exp}

--- 

Let $X$ and $Y$ denote a random variables, and let $a$ and $b$ denote constants. Then we have the following properties.

- $E(a) = a$
- $E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)$


# Properties of Variance {#sec-prop-var}

---

- For any random variable $X$, we have $\mbox{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - \mu_X^2$.

-  If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables and $a$ and $b$ constants, then $\mbox{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \mbox{Var}(X) + b^2 \mbox{Var}(Y)$.

## Question 6

---

The data set *spotify-hits.csv*^[Downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019){target="_blank"} May 4, 2023] is stored online and contains audio statistics of the top 2000 tracks on Spotify from 2000-2019. The data is stored in a <span style="color:dodgerblue">**comma separated file (csv)**</span>. 

- We can use the function `read.csv()` to import the csv file into an R data frame we call `hits`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| output: false
hits <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory/main/Data/spotify-hits.csv")
```

In the code cell below: 

- We convert `artist`, `song`, and `genre` to categorical variables using the `factor()` function.
- Extract the variables `artist`, `song`, `energy`, `acousticness`, and `genre` (ignoring the rest).
- Print the first 6 rows to screen to get a glimpse of the resulting data frame.

```{r}
#| eval: true
hits$artist <- factor(hits$artist)  # artist is categorical
hits$song <- factor(hits$song)  # song is categorical
hits$genre <- factor(hits$genre)  # genre is categorical
hits <- hits[,c("artist", "song", "energy", "acousticness", "genre")] 
head(hits)  # display first 6 rows of data frame
```


- **Energy**:  A measure of how energetic a song is from $0.0$ to $1.0$ (least to most energy) of. Typically, energetic songs are fast, loud, and noisy.
- **Acousticness**: A measure from $0.0$ to $1.0$ (least to most acoustic) of depending on how significant the use of acoustic instruments are in the song.

Let $X$ denote the energy of a randomly selected song, and let $Y$ denote the acousticness of a randomly selected song. We define a new song metric, $Z$, that is a weighted mean of score $X$ and $Y$:

$$Z = \frac{3X + 2Y}{5}$$

### Question 6a

---

Do you believe $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables? Explain why or why not.

#### Solution to Question 6a

---


<br>  
<br>  
<br>  



### Question 6b

---

Use R to compute $E(X)$, $E(Y)$, and $E(Z)$. Check whether or not the property $E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)$ holds in this context.

- Hint: Recall R, the function `mean(x)` calculates the mean (expected value) of `x`.


#### Solution to Question 6b

---

```{r}
x <- hits$energy  # random variable x
y <- hits$acousticness  # random variable y
z <- (3*x + 2*y) / 5  # random variable z
```

```{r}
# use code cell to compare expected values

```


<br>  
<br>  
<br>  

### Question 6c

---

Use R to compute $\mbox{Var}(X)$, $\mbox{Var}(Y)$, and $\mbox{Var}(Z)$. Check whether or not the property $\mbox{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\mbox{Var}(X) + b^2\mbox{Var}(Y)$ holds in this context. 

- Hint: The function `var(x)` calculates the variance of `x`.

#### Solution to Question 6c

---

```{r}
# use code cell to compare variances


```


<br>  
<br>  
<br>  


### Question 6d

---

Determine whether each of the statements below are true or false. If false, explain why.

For any two random variables $X$ and $Y$ and constants $a$ and $b$:

- It always follows that $E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)$.
- It always follows that $\mbox{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\mbox{Var}(X) + b^2\mbox{Var}(Y)$.
