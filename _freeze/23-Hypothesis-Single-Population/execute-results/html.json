There is an unknown population parameter, and we would like estimate or assess claims about the parameter. We collect sample data, and:\n\n- With **confidence intervals (CI)**, we **estimate** the value of a population parameter building in a **margin of error** that is derived from a sampling distribution.\n- With **hypothesis tests**, we use a null distribution to measure whether a sample test statistic sufficiently contradicts the null claim. Then we **assess the competing claims** in $H_0$ and $H_a$.\n\n\nWe can apply [Monte Carlo resampling (bootstrapping) methods](17-Bootstrap-Confidence-Int.qmd) and/or [parametric methods](19-Parametric-CI-Means.qmd) (using the Central Limit Theorem) to model a sampling distribution that is the foundation for constructing a confidence interval. Similarly, for hypothesis tests we have both resampling and parametric methods for measuring the significance of test statistics.\n\n- We explored [permutation distributions](22-Permutation-Tests.qmd) as one resampling method for calculating p-values.\n- We can use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to model null distributions and calculate p-values.\n\n\n# What is Significant Enough?\n\n---\n\nThe general process form performing a hypothesis test is informally:\n\n1. State the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of population parameter(s).\n2. Collect data from a sample and calculate a test statistic.\n3. Calculate the p-value to measure the significance of the test statistic.\n4. Make a conclusion (if possible).\n5. Clearly summarize the results for a general audience.\n\nWe have discussed [Steps 1 and 2](21-Intro-Hypothesis-Tests.qmd) and used [resampling methods](22-Permutation-Tests.qmd) as one method to calculate p-values in Step 3. Refer to [Appendix A](#sec-appenda) for a summary of the steps outlined above.  Before investigating parametric methods for computing p-values, let's discuss steps and 4 and 5:\n\n> How do we use p-values to decide whether the evidence is significant enough to reject $H_0$ and accept the claim we hoped to prove in $H_a$?\n\n- The **smaller the p-value**, the **stronger the evidence** contradicting $H_0$.\n- How small does the p-value need to be in order to claim the evidence is strong enough to reject $H_0$?\n\n## The Significance Level\n\n---\n\nThe <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**significance level**</span> of a test, denoted ${\\color{dodgerblue}{\\alpha}}$, is the value **we choose** that is used to **determine whether the p-value is small enough** to claim the result is statistically significant and reject $H_0$.\n\n- <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">If p-value $\\leq \\alpha$, we reject $H_0$.</span>\n- <span style=\"color:tomato\">If p-value $> \\alpha$, we do not reject $H_0$.</span>\n\nGenerally speaking, $H_0$ is a claim we currently accept as true. $H_a$ is some new and interesting result that if true would contradict the currently accepted belief in $H_0$. We typically require compelling evidence, beyond a \"reasonable doubt\", to reject the currently accepted claim in $H_0$ in favor of a new and competing claim in $H_a$. \n\n- The default significance level is typically 5% (or $\\alpha = 0.05$).\n- Some other (less) common significance levels are $\\alpha = 0.1$, $0.01$ or $0.001$. \n- The smaller we set $\\alpha$, the more certainty we require to reject $H_0$.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe significance level is not something we compute. We choose the significance level for the test, and the significance level should be determined prior to our analysis. Do not first calculate the p-value, and then retroactively choose the significance level to ensure the result is significant.\n:::\n\n## Summarizing the Results\n\n---\n\nThere are two possible results with hypothesis tests:\n\n- If <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">p-value $\\leq \\alpha$</span>, the test is <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">statistically significant</span>.\n\n  - There is strong enough evidence to reject $H_0$.\n  - And thus, we accept the competing claim  in $H_a$.\n\n- If <span style=\"color:tomato\">p-value $> \\alpha$</span>, the test is <span style=\"color:tomato\">not statistically significant</span> and there is not sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$:\n\n  - We fail to reject $H_0$ (which is different from accepting $H_0$).\n  - The test is inconclusive regarding the claims in $H_0$ and $H_a$.\n\nIn the end, we want to be sure we communicate the results **clearly**, in **proper context**, to a more **general audience** that may not have an advanced background in statistics and mathematics.\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\n![Credit: Kelvinsong, [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0), via Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Hurricane-en.svg){fig-align=\"left\" width=60% fig-alt=\"Tropical Cyclone Structure\"}\n\nPressure is a common measurement used to characterize the strength of a storm. The lower the storm pressure, the higher the wind speeds, and the more dangerous the storm. Let $\\mu$ denote the mean pressure (in millibars) of all storms in the North Atlantic. Suppose we set up the following hypothesis to test claims about the value of $\\mu$.\n\n- $H_0$: $\\mu = 950$. The mean pressure of all storms in the North Atlantic is 950 millibars.\n- $H_a$: $\\mu \\ne 950$. The mean pressure of all storms in the North Atlantic is not 950 millibars.\n\nWe collect a random sample of $n$ storm pressure observations with a sample mean larger than 950 millibars that has a p-value equal to $0.012$.\n\n### Question 1a \n\n---\n\nSummarize the results if we perform the hypothesis test using a 5% significance level.

The mean pressure of all storms in the North Atlantic is 950 millibars.\n- $H_a$: $\\mu > 950$. The mean pressure of all storms in the North Atlantic is greater than 950 millibars.\n\nAssume we still have the same sample of size $n$ with the same sample mean (which is greater than 950 millibars) as in [Question 1](#23q1). Recall this sample has a p-value equal to $0.012$ for a two-tailed test. Using the same sample, we now test the one-tailed hypotheses instead.\n\n- What would be the p-value for this same sample be if we use this one-tailed test instead?\n- Summarize the result of the one-tailed test in practical terms if we use a significance level of 5%.\n- Summarize the result of the one-tailed test in practical terms if we use a significance level of 1%.\n\n#### Solution to Question 1d \n\n----\n\n<br>  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n\n# Test For a Single Proportion\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Question 2\n\n---\n\n![Credit: Mbz1, [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), via Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Paul_the_Octopus.jpg){fig-align=\"left\" width=40% fig-alt=\"Paul the Oracle Octopus\"}\n\nIn the 2010 World Cup in Germany, Paul the octopus (aka the Oracle Octopus) correctly predicted the correct outcome in all 8 of the matches he predicted. Paul beat out his rival Mani, Singapore's psychic parakeet, who predicted six matches in a row before missing a prediction. Below is an excerpt from a recent article^[\"The 'psychic' animals predicting who will win the World Cup\", [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/psychic-animals-predicting-win-world-cup/story?id=93915441){target=\"_blank\"}, accessed July 13, 2023.] about animal clairvoyance and the World Cup.\n\n\n> No FIFA World Cup would be complete without \"psychic\" animals predicting the winners, and Qatar 2022 has been no exception. From \"clairvoyant\" camels to \"mystic\" elephants and \"cryptic\" rats, a range of animals -- big and small -- have tried their paws, hooves and tentacles at predicting the score line. <br>  <br>  It all started with Paul, the \"psychic\" octopus. The eight-tentacled icon put TV pundits to shame with an incredible string of correct World Cup winner predictions from his glass tank at the Aquarium Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen, Germany. The tentacled tipster had an incredible success rate: he correctly predicted eight world cup matches at South Africa's tournament in 2010, including Spain beating the Netherlands in the World Cup final.\n\nIn 2010, Paul the Octopus \"predicted\" 8 matches and made 8 correct predictions. **Is this evidence that Paul actually has psychic powers?**\n\n### Question 2a\n\n---\n\nSet up the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the proportion of all World Cup matches ever played that Paul correctly predicts.

A physician suspects males in her town seem to be taller than average when compared to the population of all adult males in the UK. She collects data from a random sample of $n=25$ adult males from the town and calculates the mean height of the sample is $69.25$ inches.\n\n\n\n### Question 3a\n\n---\n\nSet up the null and alternative hypotheses (both in words and using appropriate notation) to test the physician's claim that adult males in the town are taller than the national average height for all adult males in the UK. \n\n#### Solution to Question 3a\n\n---\n\n-   $H_0$: ??\n\n-   $H_a$: ??\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 3b\n\n---\n\nCompute the test statistic.\n\n#### Solution to Question 3b\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 3c\n\n---\n\nWhat is a reasonable null distribution to use to perform this test?

Nevertheless, we can still conduct a hypothesis test on a single mean, but there will be some additional uncertainty due to our need to estimate $\\sigma^2$. Below we work through an example using the `storms` data frame in the `dplyr` package to devise a method for computing p-values under these circumstances.\n\n## Picking a Random Sample of Storm Pressures\n\n--- \n\nThe `storms` data set is from the [NOAA Hurricane Best Track Data](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat){target=\"_blank\"}.
