For example, if we randomly select an adult from the population:\n\n-   A person is most likely to be about average height.\n-   Otherwise, the person selected is equally likely to be either shorter or taller than average.\n-   The person is very unlikely to have an extreme height (tall or short). The more extreme, the less likely.\n-   **Therefore the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric and bell shaped.**\n\n<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Normal distributions**</span> arise in many settings: heights of people, size of items produced by machines, and most importantly in statistics, data sets resulting from many independent random events. The shape of a normal distribution is determined by two parameters:\n   \n-   The <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**mean**</span>, $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mu}$, is the center of the distribution.\n-   The <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**standard deviation**</span> $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\sigma}$, tells us how wide the distribution is.\n-   If $X$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, we write $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mathbf{X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)}}$.\n-   The resulting distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](08-Common-Continuous-Distributions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](08-Common-Continuous-Distributions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\nWhat effect does increasing the standard deviation have on the shape of a normal distribution? What effect does increasing the mean have on the shape of a normal distribution?\n\n### Solution to Question 1\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# The 68%-95%-99.7% Empirical Rule {#sec-empirical}\n\n---\n\nThe <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**empirical rule**</span> for normal distributions states approximately:\n\n-   68% of all values fall within one standard deviation (both above and below) from the mean.\n-   95% of all values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.\n-   99.7% of all values fall within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\n\n![Image Credit: Adam Spiegler, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), via Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/08fig-empirical.png){fig-alt=\"Illustration of Empirical Rule for Normal Distributions\"} \n\n::: {.callout-caution}\nThis rule does not apply to all distributions. The less normal the data, the less accurate the rule becomes.\n:::\n\n## Question 2\n\n---\n\nCholesterol is a fat-like substance present in all cells in your body. Humans require some cholesterol to properly function and remain healthy. If a person’s blood has too much cholesterol, then they are at a higher risk of developing heart disease. A blood test is used to measure\ncholesterol levels.  Below is an excerpt from a study^[Prasad Tharu B, Tsokos CP. *A Statistical Study of Serum Cholesterol Level by Gender and Race*. J Res Health Sci. 2017 Jul 25. ] on the distribution of cholesterol levels.\n\n> Cholesterol is a growing issue because of its impact on human health. Cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol are the most clearly established risk factors that have been identified as being strongly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). Total serum cholesterol level (SCL) is a major risk factor for CHD which is the leading cause of death in the United States. CHD is responsible for more deaths than all forms of cancer combined. \n\nThe distribution of cholesterol levels for adults age 20 or older is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 200\nmg/dL and standard deviation 40 mg/dL. Let $X$ be the cholesterol level of a randomly selected adult age 20 or above. Thus, we have $X \\sim N(200, 40)$.\n\n\n### Question 2a\n\n---\n\nWhat proportion of adults age 20 or above have total cholesterol levels between 200 mg/dL and 240 mg/dL?\n\n#### Solution to Question 2a\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n### Question 2b\n\n---\n\nWhat proportion of adults age 20 or above have total cholesterol levels between 160 mg/dL and 280 mg/dL?\n\n#### Solution to Question 2b\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 2c\n\n---\n\nIndividuals that have a total cholesterol level more than 240 mg/dL should be regarded as high risk for heart disease. What proportion of the adult population age 20 or above is at high risk for heart disease?\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 2c\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n### Question 2d\n\n---\n\nHow many standard deviations from the mean is a total cholesterol level of 140 mg/dL?\n\n#### Solution to Question 2d\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# $z$-Scores and the Standard Normal Distribution {#sec-zscore}\n\n---\n\nThe number of standard deviations a data value $x$ is from the mean $\\mu$ is called the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**z-score**</span> for the value $x$.\n\n- We compute the signed distance of $x$ from the mean, $\\mu$.\n- Then we describe the distance in terms of standard deviations (as opposed to in units of $x$).\n- The formula for the $z$-score of $x$ is therefore\n\n$$\\color{dodgerblue}{\\large z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}}.$$\n\nFor example, the $z$-score of an adult with a total cholesterol level of 140 mg/dL is $z=\\frac{140-200}{40} = -1.5$. This means a total cholesterol level of 140 mg/dL is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean level.\n\n\n![Image Credit: Adam Spiegler, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), via Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/08fig-standardize.png){fig-alt=\"Standardizing a normal distribution\"} \n\n- Comparing areas in the figure above, we see that $P(X<140) = P(Z < -1.5) $.\n- <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Thus, using either the original distribution or the distribution of $z$-scores gives the same result.**</span>\n\n\nWhen we compute the $z$-score, we are <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**\"standardizing\"**</span> the normally distributed data. We describe values of random variable $X$ in terms of how many standard deviations each value $x$ is from the mean $\\mu$. The resulting distribution of $z$-scores is called the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**standard normal distribution**</span> that has mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$. \n\n## Question 3\n\n---\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI) is often used as a measurement to determine whether a person's weight is considered healthy. BMI is computed by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by their height (in meters) squared . BMI is easy and inexpensive to measure, thus it is frequently used to screen for whether a person is malnourished, healthy, or overweight. For example, some countries have passed laws preventing companies from hiring models that are considered underweight based on BMI.\n\n> Israel became the first country ever to pass legislation banning the use of \"underweight\" models in local ads and publications. The new law employs an interesting tactic: Models must prove that their Body Mass Index (BMI) is higher than the World Health Organization's indication of malnourishment (a BMI of 18.5) by producing an up-to-date medical report --- no older than three months --- at all shoots to be used in the Israeli market^[\"Israel Passes Law Requiring Models to Show Health Records and Meet Weight Standards\", *New York Magazine* by Charlotte Cowles on April 20, 2012].\n\nLike heights and cholesterol levels, BMI distribution is approximately normal. In Israel, adult women have a mean BMI of $26.5$ with a standard deviation $4.5$.\n\n### Question 3a\n\n---\n\nCalculate the $z$-score of an adult Israeli woman with a BMI of $18.5$.\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 3a\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 3b\n\n---\n\nInterpret the meaning of the value in [Question 3a], and give an estimate for the proportion of adult women in Israel who are legally underweight.\n\n#### Solution to Question 3b\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n# The Probability Density Function for Normal Distributions\n\n---\n\nThe probability density function for a normal distribution $X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)$ is called a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Gaussian function**</span> whose formula is\n\n$$\\color{dodgerblue}{\\large f(x; \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2}}.$$\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe formula for a Gaussian depends on both irrational numbers $\\pi$ and $e$.  How surprising and cool is that!\n:::\n\n\n# Calculating Areas Under Normal Distributions\n\n---\n\nTo find the probability that an adult woman in Israel has a BMI less than $18.5$, we need to calculate the area to the left of $x=18.5$ under the normal curve with formula $f(x; 26.5, 4.5)$. We can try to evaluate\n\n$$P(X < 18.5) = \\int_{0}^{18.5} \\frac{1}{4.5\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x-26.5}{4.5} \\right)^2} \\, dx$$\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nYIKES, good luck with that! We cannot find a formula for the antiderivative of $f(x; 26.5, 4.5)$, so we need to find other methods for calculating this area.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Using a Standard Normal Distribution Table\n\n---\n\nA standard normal distribution table can be used to determine the areas under the standard normal distribution, $N(0,1)$. There are different variations of standard normal distributions. The table in the figure below gives the area under the standard normal distribution to the left of a given $z$-score. For example, if we want to determine what proportion of adult women in Israel have a BMI less than $18.5$:\n\n1. Find the corresponding $z$-score of the BMI measurement $x=18.5$. In [Question 3a], we determined $z \\approx -1.78$.\n2. Look down the first column of the table and identify the row corresponding to the $z$-score to one decimal place of accuracy, $z=-1.7$\n3. Identify the column corresponding to the second decimal place of the $z$-score, $0.08$.\n4. The area to the left of $z=-1.78$ is the value located at the intersection of the row in step 2 and column in step 3.\n\nFrom the figure below, we have $P(X < 18.5) = P(Z < -1.78) \\approx 0.0375$.\n\n\n![Using a Standard Normal Distribution Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory/main/Images/08fig-normal-table.png){width=\"70%\"}\n\n\n## Using R to Compute Areas\n\n---\n\nStandard normal distribution tables were very useful prior to spread statistical software and technology. If we are working in R, we do not need to use tables to get approximations. Instead, we can use R functions to compute these areas more accurately. \n\nSimilar to binomial, geometric, and Poisson distributions, R has built in functions to perform calculations with normal distributions. In particular, the function `pnorm()` calculates values of the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution:\n\n-   `pnorm(x, mean, sd)`$=P(X<x)$ gives the area to the left of $x$ under $N(\\mu,\\sigma)$.\n-   `pnorm(x, mean,  sd, lower.tail=FALSE)`$=P(X>x)$ gives the area to the right of $x$ under $N(\\mu,\\sigma)$.\n\nOr you can find the $z$-score and use the standard normal distribution in R as well:\n\n-   `pnorm(z, 0, 1)`$=P(Z<z)$ gives the area to the left of $x$ under $N(0,1)$.\n-   `pnorm(z, 0,  1, lower.tail=FALSE)`$=P(Z>z)$ gives the area to the right of $x$ under $N(0,1)$.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nDo not use the function `dnorm(x, mean, sd)` to compute probabilities related to normal distribution since `dnorm()` returns the height of the probability density function. For continuous random variables, $P(X < x)$ is the area to the left of $x$, not the height of the function. Be sure to use `pnorm(x, mean, sd)` to compute $P(X < x)$. \n:::\n\n\n## Question 4\n\n---\n\nUse R to compute the proportion of adult women in Israel that have a BMI below $18.5$.\n\n### Solution to Question 4\n\n---\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# use code cell to help with calculation in question 4\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n## Question 5\n\n---\n\nIntelligence quotient (IQ) scores are normally distributed.

The pdf is given by\n\n$$f(x;r, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{(r-1)!} \\lambda^r x^{r-1} e^{-\\lambda x} \\quad \\mbox{for } x >0 .$$\n\n\n- The expected value is $E(X) = \\dfrac{r}{\\lambda}$\n- The variance is $\\mbox{Var}(X) = \\dfrac{r}{\\lambda^2}$.\n- Use `dgamma(x, r, lambda)` to find the height of the pdf function which is generally not too useful.\n  - <span style=\"color:tomato\">**DO NOT use `dgamma()` to compute probabilities.**</span>\n- Use `pgamma(x, r, lambda)` to calculate $P(X \\leq x)$.\n- Use `rgamma(n, r, lambda)` to generate a random sample of size $n$ from population $X \\sim \\mbox{Gamma}(r, \\lambda)$.\n- Use `qgamma(q, r, lambda)` to find the q^th^ percentile.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](08-Common-Continuous-Distributions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n---\n\n![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png) <nbsp>\n\n*Statistical Methods: Exploring the Uncertain* by [Adam Spiegler](https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).",
