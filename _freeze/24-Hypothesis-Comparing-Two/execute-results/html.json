Often in statistics we would like to investigate whether one variable is associated to another. For example:\n\n- Q1:   Is a new medication more effective at preventing disease than current treatments?\n- Q2:   Is there a gender pay gap in the US?\n- Q3:   Is there a region in the North Atlantic where storm strength is greatest?\n\nIf we are using one variable to help us understand or predict the values (or category) of another variable:\n\n-   We call the first variable the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**explanatory, independent, or predictor variable**</span>.\n-   The second the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**response or dependent variable**</span>.\n-   Different categories of a predictor variable are called <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**treatments or levels**</span>.\n\n\nIn this section, we develop a parametric method to perform hypothesis tests that compare the response of one variable for two different levels of an explanatory variable.  \n\n- The **explanatory variable** is **categorical**, and we compare **two levels** to each other.\n- The response variable may be a categorical or a quantitative variable.\n  - For a **quantitative response**, we make claims about a **difference in means**.\n  - For a **categorical response**, we make claims about a **difference in proportions**.\n\n\n# Questions that Compare Two Populations\n\n---\n\nIn many cases, the explanatory variable of interest in our question has more than just two levels. We can apply hypothesis tests on two populations to compare **two levels of the explanatory variable**. Often the researchers have a goal in mind, and they choose which two levels they would like to compare and/or how the levels are defined. Another group of researchers might approach the same statistical question from a different perspective and choose a different set up.\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\nSuppose the explanatory variable for statistical questions Q1, Q2, and Q3 are:\n\n- Q1:  *Medication Type*\n- Q2:  *Gender*\n- Q3:  *Latitude*\n\nIn the questions below, set up null and alternative hypothesis (in words and symbolically) to perform a hypothesis test to answer the statistical question.\n\n### Question 1a\n\n---\n\nQ1: **Is a new medication more effective at preventing disease than current treatments?**\n\nIn general, we might be interested in comparing several treatments. For example, the variable *Medication Type* could have four different levels: Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C, and No Treatment. Within our hypothesis test framework, we can compare two different treatments types. Set up hypotheses for the following question:\n\n> <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">Does xylitol (a sweetener) reduce ear infections in children compared to no treatment (control)?</span>\n\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 1a\n\n---\n\n- $H_0$:\n\n- $H_a$:\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 1b\n\n--- \n\nQ2: **Is there a gender pay gap in the US?**\n\nThe explanatory variable *Gender* may be gathered using different methods: free response question, multiple choice question (with various ways of defining the choices), or pulled directly from available records. Suppose we would like to focus on identifying if there is a pay gap between men and women that have just completed a bachelor's degree in the US. Set up hypothesis for the following question:\n\n> <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">Do women that have recently completed a bachelor's degree in the US get paid less, on average, compared to men that have recently completed a bachelor's degree?</span>\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe **median** is often used as the measure of center to summarize income since the distribution of income is typically heavily skewed. Outliers will have a bigger influence in the analysis if we compare means. With the median,  outliers have as much influence as any other observation. However, there is no parametric method for testing claims about medians.\n:::\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 1b\n\n---\n\n- $H_0$:\n\n- $H_a$:\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n\n### Question 1c\n\n--- \n\nQ3:   **Is there a region in the North Atlantic where storm strength is greatest?**\n\nThe explanatory variable *Latitude* is typically a quantitative variable given in degrees north or south of the equator. There are many different ways a researcher can define different regions, and how they define those regions depends on the data available and their research goals. Set up hypothesis for the following question:\n\n> <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">Is the storm pressure different, on average, for storms in the North Atlantic above the Tropic of Cancer compared to those below the Tropic of Cancer?</span>\n\n#### Solution to Question 1c\n\n---\n\n- $H_0$:\n\n- $H_a$:\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n# Hypothesis Tests for Comparing Two Populations\n\n---\n\nWhen doing a hypothesis test for a difference between population means or two population proportions, we apply the same steps as with previous tests. See [Appendix A](#sec-appenda) for a summary of the steps below.\n\n1. Set up hypotheses.\n    - <span style=\"color:tomato\">$H_0$: There is no difference between the two levels.</span>\n    - <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">$H_a$: There is a difference between the two levels.</span>\n2. Collect data, calculate the difference in sample statistics, and find a test statistic.\n3. Calculate the p-value.\n4. Based on the significance level, $\\alpha$, make a conclusion.\n5. Summarize the results in context.\n\nIn our previous work with hypothesis tests on two populations, we used  [two-sample permutations tests](22-Permutation-Tests.qmd) to find standardized test statistics and p-values in steps 2 and 3. We now devise parametric methods for hypothesis tests that compare two populations.\n\n\n## A General Test Statistic\n\n---\n\nWe can apply the Central Limit Theorem, CLT, to standardize the test statistic and calculate p-values using the same strategy as the parametric approach for testing claims about a [single population](23-Hypothesis-Single-Population.qmd).  We begin by assuming the claim in the null hypothesis is true:\n\n- <span style=\"color:tomato\">$H_0$: There is no difference. For example, $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 =0$ or $p_1 -p_2 = 0$.</span>\n\nThe <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**standardized test statistic**</span> is the $z$-score or t-test statistic corresponding to the observed difference in sample statistics:\n\n$${\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mbox{stand test stat} = \\frac{ (\\mbox{diff in sample stats}) - ({\\color{tomato}{\\mbox{diff in null claim}}})}{\\mbox{SE of Null Dist}} = \\frac{ (\\mbox{diff in sample stats}) - {\\color{tomato}{0}}}{\\mbox{SE of Null Dist}}}}.$$\n\nTo calculate the standardized test statistic, we consider the following questions:\n\n1. Do the samples satisfies [conditions for CLT](#sec-samp-size)?\n2. What is the correct probability distribution to use, a **t-distribution or a normal distribution**?\n3. What is the **difference in observed sample statistics**?\n4. What is an estimate for the **standard error** of the null distribution?\n\n\n# Difference in Two Means: Parametric Method\n\n---\n\n## Question 2\n\n---\n\n\nIf we are doing a test on a difference of means from two independent populations, then the null claim is <span style=\"color:tomato\">$H_0$: $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2=0$</span> and recall the [CLT for a difference in means](19-Parametric-CI-Means.qmd#sec-clt-diff-means) is\n\n$$\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2  \\sim N \\left( {\\color{tomato}{\\mu_1 - \\mu_2}} , {\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mbox{SE}}} \\right) = N \\left( {\\color{tomato}{0}} , {\\color{dodgerblue}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} } \\right).$$\nSuppose we are performing a test on the difference of two independent means, $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$, and the **population variances $\\sigma_1^2$ and $\\sigma_2^2$ are unknown**.\n\n- What are reasonable estimates to use in place of $\\sigma_1^2$ and $\\sigma_2^2$?\n- What is a formula for estimating the standard error of the null distribution?\n- Should we use a t-distribution or normal distribution to approximate the null distribution?\n\nBased on your answers to the previous questions, fill in the blanks label (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) to give a formula for standardized test statistic.  *In blank (i), enter either $z$ or $t$ depending on whether a normal or t-distribution is appropriate.*\n\n\n$${\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mbox{(i)} = \\frac{ (\\mbox{diff in sample stats}) - ({\\color{tomato}{\\mbox{diff in null claim}}})}{\\mbox{SE of Null Dist}} = \\frac{ \\mbox{(ii)} - {\\color{tomato}{\\mbox{(iii)}}}}{\\mbox{(iv)}}}}.$$\n\n### Solution to Question 2\n\n---\n\nComplete the formula for the standardized test statistic:\n\n- Choose either $z$ or $t$ for blank (i).\n\n- Blank (ii) is ??\n\n- Blank (iii) is ??\n\n- Blank (iv) is ??\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n## Question 3\n\n---\n\nWe return to our statistical question and hypothesis from [Question 1b] regarding a possible gender pay gap in the US. We collect data from a random sample of people that completed their bachelor's degree in 2021 and compare the starting salaries of men and women in the sample. A sample of 154 women have a mean income of $\\$52,\\!266$ with standard deviation $\\$15,\\!510$ A sample of 122 men have a mean income of $\\$64,\\!022$ with a standard deviation of $\\$16,\\!890$. \n\nIs there enough evidence to support the claim that women who have recently completed a bachelor's degree in the US get paid less, on average, compared to men who have recently completed a bachelor's degree? Test using a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe statistical question in this example as well as the data are motivated by an analysis of students that earned a bachelor's degree in the US in 2021 by the [National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE)](https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/graduate-outcomes/first-destination/).\n:::\n\n### Solution to Question 3\n\n---\n\nUsing the hypotheses you set up in [Question 1b], answer the following:\n\n\n\na. Based on the sample data, compute the standardized test statistic.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# calculate standardized test statistic\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\nb.  Based on your standardized test statistic, compute the p-value.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compute p-value\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\nc.  Make a decision and summarize the results in the context of this example.\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n\n\n## Using `t.test()` to Compare Two Populations\n\n---\n\nTo calculate a p-value for a test on the difference of means from two independent populations with unknown variances, we can calculate the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**t-test statistic**</span> \n\n$${\\boxed{\\color{dodgerblue}{{\\color{tomato}{t}} = \\frac{ \\mbox{diff in sample stats} - 0}{\\mbox{SE of Null Dist}} = \\dfrac{(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) - 0 }{\\sqrt{\\frac{{\\color{tomato}{s_1}}^2}{n_1} + \\frac{{\\color{tomato}{s_2}}^2}{n_2}}}}}}.$$\n\nIn [Question 3], you were conveniently provided numerical summaries of each sample that we substituted into the formula for the t-test statistic. Then we can err on the side caution and choose the **degrees of freedom**, $df$, to be the **smaller of either** $\\mathbf{n_1-1}$ or $\\mathbf{n_2-1}$.\n\nIf we have access to all the sample data (not just summaries), then we can load the sample data into R and use the `t.test()` function to calculates both the t-test statistic and p-value using a more accurate approximation for $df$ obtained using [Welch's approximation](19-Parametric-CI-Means.qmd#sec-informal).\n\n### Samples Stored as Separate Vectors {#sec-alt}\n\n---\n\nIn R, we can use the command `t.test(x1, x2, alt = [direction])`.\n  \n- Samples are stored in independent vectors `x1` and `x2`.\n- Set the option `alt` based on the inequality used in $H_a$.\n  - Use `\"greater\"` for right-tail test.\n  - Use `\"less\"` for left-tail test.\n  - Use `\"two.sided\"` for a two-tail test.\n  - If you do not indicate any `alt` option, the default is a two-tailed test.\n- The default is `mu=0` which is exactly what we want, so we do not specify this option.\n\n### Subsetting Samples Inside `t.test()`\n\n---\n\nFrequently, we would like to compare the means of a quantitative response variable, denoted `quant`, for two different levels of a categorical explanatory variable, denoted `categorical`, in the data frame named `data.name`. The `t.test()` function can simultaneously subset the `quant` data into two independent samples (one for each level of `category`) and then perform a hypothesis test for the difference in two means:\n\n<center>\n`t.test(quant ~ categorical, data = data.name, alt = [direction])` \n</center>\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\nIf the `categorical` variable has exactly two levels, then the command `t.test(quant ~ categorical, data = data.name, alt = [direction])` works as desired. However, if  `categorical` has more than two levels, this results in an error. If there are more than two levels, you can first subset or filter the data and then use `t.test()`.\n:::\n\n## Question 4\n\n---\n\nWe use the `storms` data set from the [NOAA Hurricane Best Track Data](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat) in the `dplyr` package to test if the storm pressure is different, on average, for storms in the North Atlantic above the Tropic of Cancer compared to those below the Tropic of Cancer.\n\n- Run the code cell below to load the `dplyr` package (which should already be installed).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)  # load dplyr package\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Question 4a\n\n---\n\nRun the code cell below to calculate the p-value of the sample data in `storms`. Interpret the meaning of the output.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(pressure ~ lat, data = storms, alt = \"two.tail\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 4a\n\n--- \n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 4b\n\n---\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer is the most northerly circle of latitude on Earth at which the Sun can be directly overhead. The position of this circle is constantly wobbling just slightly. The Tropic of Cancer is currently located at $23.43623^{\\circ}$ north of the Equator. \n\n\n#### Creating Levels for the Explanatory Variable with `mutate()`\n\n---\n\nThe code cell use the [`mutate()` function](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/07/how-to-use-mutate-function-in-r/) that is in the `dplyr` package to create and add a new categorical variable, we name `tropic`, consisting of two levels (`above` and `below`) depending on whether the storm's location is above or below the Tropic of Cancer.  Then the `tapply()` function is used to calculate separate means for the sample of storms above and below the Tropic of Cancer.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe data frame `storms` and `mutate()` script are both in the `dplyr` package.  Be sure you have already run `library(dplyr)` before running the code cell below.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create and add new variable tropic to storms\nstorms <- mutate(storms, \n                 tropic = case_when(lat < 23.43623 ~ 'below',  # below is assigned if lat < 23.43623\n                                    lat > 23.43623 ~ 'above'))  # above is assigned if lat > 23.43623\n\nstorms$tropic <- factor(storms$tropic)  # ensure tropic stored as categorical factor\ntapply(storms$pressure, storms$tropic, mean)  # compare mean pressures\n```\n:::\n\n\n**After running the code cell above, complete the code cell below to create side-by-side box plots of the distributions of storm pressures above and below the Tropic of Cancer.**\n\n#### Solution to Question 4b\n\n----\n\nReplace each ?? with an appropriate variable or data frame name.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(?? ~ ??, data = ??)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n### Question 4c\n\n---\n\nFill in the `t.test()` function below to compute the test statistic and corresponding p-value based on the sample data in `storms` to test the hypothesis in [Question 1c]\n\n#### Solution to Question 4c\n\n---\n\nComplete and run the code cell below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(?? ~ ??, data = ??, alt = ??)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>\n\n### Question 4d\n\n---\n\nBased on the output in [Question 4c], summarize the result of this test in practical terms. Use a significance level of 5%.\n\n#### Solution to Question 4d\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# Difference in Proportions: A Parametric Method\n\n---\n\nIf we are doing a test on a difference of two proportions, then the null claim is <span style=\"color:tomato\">$H_0$: $p_1 - p_2=0$</span>. We use the difference in sample proportions, ${\\color{dodgerblue}{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}}$, as the test statistic:\n\n\n$${\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mbox{stand test stat} = \\frac{ (\\mbox{diff in sample stats}) - ({\\color{tomato}{\\mbox{diff in null claim}}})}{\\mbox{SE of Null Dist}} = \\frac{ (\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) - {\\color{tomato}{0}}}{\\mbox{SE of Null Dist}}}}.$$\n\nFrom the [CLT for a difference in proportions](20-Parametric-CI-Proportions.qmd#sec-clt-diffprop) we have\n\n$$\\widehat{P}_1 - \\widehat{P}_2  \\sim N \\left( {\\color{tomato}{p_1 - p_2}} , {\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mbox{SE}}} \\right) = N \\left( {\\color{tomato}{0}} , {\\color{dodgerblue}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}} } \\right).$$\n\n## Question 5\n\n---\n\nWhen doing a test on the difference of two proportions, the null hypothesis is the claim $p_1 - p_2 = 0$ or $p_1 = p_2$. \n\n- We have not claimed anything about the value of $p_1$ on its own. \n- We have not claimed anything about the value of $p_2$ on its own. \n\n**What is a reasonable estimate to plug in place of $p_1$ and $p_2$ in the formula for the standard error?**\n\n\n### Solution ot Question 5\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n## Defining a Test Statistic\n\n---\n\nLet $X_1$ and $X_2$ denote the number of successes in samples 1 and 2 with sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively.\n\n\n- We use a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**normal distribution**</span> to model the null distribution (as long as both samples are [large enough](#sec-samp-size)).\n- In $H_0$, we assume there is no difference in the two groups, so we pool the samples together and calculate the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**sample pooled proportion**</span>:\n\n$${\\color{tomato}{\\mbox{sample pooled proportion} = \\hat{p}_p = \\frac{X_1 + X_2}{n_1 + n_2}}}.$$\n\n- To estimate the standard error, we use  ${\\color{tomato}{\\hat{p}_p}}$ in place of both $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n- The standardized test statistic is the z-score of the difference in sample proportions:\n\n$$\\boxed{{\\color{dodgerblue}{z = \\dfrac{ (\\mbox{diff in sample stats}) - (\\mbox{diff in null claim})}{\\mbox{SE of Null Dist}}= \\dfrac{(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) - 0 }{\\sqrt{{\\color{tomato}{\\hat{p}_p}}(1 -{\\color{tomato}{\\hat{p}_p}})\\left( \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} \\right)}}}}}.$$\n\n\n## Calculating the p-Value\n\n---\n\nWhen doing a hypothesis test on a difference of two proportions, we use a normal distribution to estimate the null distribution and calculate p-values. If we denote the z-score of the observed difference in sample means as `z`, then:\n\n-   For a left-tailed test, p-value = `pnorm(z, 0, 1)`\n-   For a right-tailed test, p-value = `1 - pnorm(z, 0, 1)`\n-   For a two-tailed test, p-value = `2 * pnorm(-1*abs(z), 0 , 1)`\n\n## Question 6\n\n---\n\n![Credit: Nick Youngson [CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) via [Pix4free.org](https://pix4free.org/)](https://pix4free.org/assets/library/2021-03-25/originals/ear_infection.jpg){fig-align=\"left\" width=50% fig-alt=\"Ear Infection Research\"}\n\n\nIt is believed that a sweetener called xylitol helps prevent ear infections. In a randomized experiment^[This example is based on research by [University of Toronto Faculty of Dentistry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8485974/). The data provided in this question has been modified from the original research.] $n_1 = 165$ children took a placebo and $68$ of them got ear infections. Another $n_2 = 159$ children took xylitol and $46$ of them got ear infections. We believe that the proportion of ear infections in the placebo group will be greater than the xylitol group. Test this claim using $\\alpha=0.01$.\n\n### Solution to Question 6\n\n---\n\nUse hypotheses from [Question 1a](#24q1a) and answer the questions below.\n\n<br>\n\n\na.

In our study, we solicit volunteers that have already given birth to two babies. During one of the pregnancies, the parent smoked. During the other pregnancy, they did not smoke. Below is hypothetical data from such a study.

State the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**hypotheses**</span> and identify (from the alternative claim in $H_a$) if it is a one or two-tailed test.\n  \n    - $H_0$ is the \"boring\" claim. Express using an equal sign $=$.\n    - $H_a$ is the claim we want to show is likely true. Use inequality sign ($>$, $<$, or $\\ne$).\n    - State both $H_0$ and $H_a$ in terms of population parameters such as $\\mu_1-\\mu_2$ and $p_1-p_2$.\n\n2. Compute the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**test statistic**</span>.\n\n    - If the observed sample contradicts the null claim, the result is significant.\n    - A standardized test statistic measures how many SE's the observed stat is from the null claim.\n    - A standardized test statistic with a large absolute value is supporting evidence to reject $H_0$.\n\n3. Using the null distribution, compute the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**p-value**</span>. The p-value is the probability of getting a sample with a test statistic as or more extreme than the observed sample assuming $H_0$ is true.\n\n    - The p-value is the area in one or both tails beyond the test statistic.\n    - The p-value is a probability, so we have $0 < \\mbox{p-value} < 1$.\n    - The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence to reject $H_0$.\n\n4. Based on the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**significance level**</span>, $\\alpha$, make a decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis\n\n    - If p-value $\\leq \\alpha$, we reject $H_0$.\n    - If p-value $> \\alpha$, we do not reject $H_0$.\n\n5.  <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Summarize the results**</span> in practical terms, **in the context of the example**.\n\n    - If we reject $H_0$, this means there is enough evidence to support the claim in $H_a$.\n    - If we do not reject $H_0$, this means there is not evidence to reject $H_0$ nor support $H_a$. The test is inconclusive.\n\n\n## Appendix B: Sample Sizes and the CLT  {#sec-samp-size}\n\n---\n\n- For a **single mean**, we can use the CTL to perform a hypothesis test as long as:\n\n  - Either the population is symmetric or $n \\geq 30$.\n  - If the sample is symmetric, we can assume the population is symmetric. \n\n- For a **difference in two means** , we can use the CTL to perform a hypothesis test as long as:\n\n  - Population 1 is either symmetric or $n_1 \\geq 30$, and \n  - Population 2 is either symmetric or $n_2 \\geq 30$.\n\n- For a **single proportion**, we can use the CTL to perform a hypothesis test as long as:\n\n  - Both $n\\hat{p} \\geq 10$ and $n(1-\\hat{p}) \\geq 10$.\n\n- For a **difference in two proportions**, we can use the CTL to perform a hypothesis test as long as:\n\n  - All of $n_1\\hat{p}_1 \\geq 10$,  $n_1(1-\\hat{p}_1) \\geq 10$,  $n_2\\hat{p}_2 \\geq 10$, and $n_2(1-\\hat{p}_2) \\geq 10$ are satisfied.\n    \n\n## Appendix C: Parametric Formulas\n\n---\n\n\n| Parameter(s)     | Sample Stat | Standard Error | Distribution |\n|------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| A single mean <br> ($\\sigma^2$ known) | $\\bar{x}$ | $\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ | $N(0,1)$ |\n| A single mean <br> ($\\sigma^2$ unknown) | $\\bar{x}$ | $\\dfrac{{\\color{tomato}{s}}}{\\sqrt{n}}$ | ${\\color{tomato}{t_{n-1}}}$ |\n| A single proportion | $\\hat{p}$ | Not Applicable | $\\mbox{Binom}(n, p_0)$ | \n| A difference in two means (unknown $\\sigma_1^2$ and $\\sigma_2^2$) | $\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2$ | $\\sqrt{\\dfrac{{\\color{tomato}{s_1}}^2}{n_1} + \\dfrac{{\\color{tomato}{s_2}}^2}{n_2}}$ | ${\\color{tomato}{t_{n_{\\rm min}-1}}}$ |\n| A difference in two proportions | $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$ | $\\sqrt{{\\color{tomato}{\\hat{p}_p}}(1 -{\\color{tomato}{\\hat{p}_p}})\\left( \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} \\right)}$ | $N(0,1)$ |\n| Mean difference between matched-pairs | $\\bar{x}_{\\rm diff}$ | $\\dfrac{{\\color{tomato}{s_{\\rm diff}}}}{\\sqrt{n}}$  | ${\\color{tomato}{t_{n-1}}}$ |\n\n---\n\n![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png) <nbsp>\n\n*Statistical Methods: Exploring the Uncertain* by [Adam Spiegler](https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).",
