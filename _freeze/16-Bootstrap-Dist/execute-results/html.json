We can generate a sampling distribution by simulating the selection of many different random samples from the population data, and we can compute the standard error of the sampling distribution to measure how much uncertainty we can expect due to the randomness of sampling. If we have access to data from the entire population, there is no need for statistics to estimate parameters since we know the values of the parameters! Recall the distinction and connection and between parameters and statistics:\n\n- A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**parameter**</span> is a characteristic of a population (which may be a probability distribution).\n  - The values of population parameters are unknown, but their values are fixed and not random.\n- A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**statistic**</span> is a characteristic of a sample that we can use to approximate a parameter.\n  - Statistics are not fixed values. They will vary due to the randomness of sampling.\n- Recall we use different notation for parameters and statistics.\n  - We typically use $\\theta$ to denote a generic population parameter.\n  - We use <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**hat notation**</span>, $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\hat{\\theta}}$, to denote estimators of $\\theta$.\n\nIn some situations, we have a known probability distribution that we can use to build a model and make predictions. For example, characteristics such as height ([normal](08-Common-Continuous-Distributions.qmd#sec-append-normal)), time between successive events ([exponential](08-Common-Continuous-Distributions.qmd#sec-append-exp)), and counting the number of times an event occurs over an interval of time all behave predictably ([Poisson](07-Common-Discrete-RandVar.qmd#sec-append-pois)). We can pick random sample and use point estimators such as [MLE](13-Estimation-MLE.qmd) and [MoM](14-Estimation-MOM.qmd) to estimate unknown population parameters. *What happens if the data does not follow a known distribution?*\n\n\nSuppose we would like to estimate the value of a parameter for a population about which we know very little information (this is often the case). We collect data from a single random sample of size $n$, and then we can use statistics from the sample to make predictions about the population:\n\n- To estimate a population mean, it makes practical and [mathematical sense to use a sample mean](15-Properties-Estimators.qmd#sec-mean-eff).\n- To estimate a population proportion, the sample proportion is an [unbiased estimator](15-Properties-Estimators.qmd#sec-prop-bias).\n- To estimate a population variance, we can use the [unbiased estimator](15-Properties-Estimators.qmd#sec-var-bias) $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$.\n\nIn any of these cases, how certain can/should we be in our estimate? In practice, we do not repeatedly pick 1000's of random samples from the population. That is likely impractical, expensive, and time consuming. We have only collected data from a single random sample.\n\n> <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**How can we account for the uncertainty in our estimate if we only have one random sample?**</span>\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\n::: {layout=\"[[55,45]]\" #fig-jackal}\n\n![Credit: Вых Пыхманн, [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0), Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Golden_jackal_-_portrait.jpg){fig-alt=\"Golden Jackal Portrait\"}\n\n![Mariomassone, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Grey_wolf_%26_golden_jackal_mandibles.jpg){fig-alt=\"Wolf and Jackal Mandible Bones\"}\n\nLeft: Golden Jackal (Canis aureus) Right: Mandible bones of wolf and jackal\n:::\n\n\nA zoologist would like to answer the following question?\n\n> What is the average mandible (jaw) length of all golden jackals (Canis aureus)?\n\nDevise a method for collecting and analyzing data to help them answer this question.\n\n\n### Solution to Question 1\n\n---\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# Case Study: Golden Jackal Mandible Length\n\n---\n\nThe data frame^[Manly, B.F.J. (2007) *Randomization, bootstrap and Monte Carlo methods in biology*. Third Edition. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Boca Raton.] `jackal` in the `permute` package contains a sample of $n=20$ mandibles from male and female golden jackals. For each of the 20 observations, two variables are recorded:\n\n- `Length` is the length of the mandible in millimeters (mm).\n- `Sex` is a categorical variable with two levels: `Male` and `Female`.\n\n\n## Loading the Data\n\n---\n\nIt is very likely you do not have the package `permute` installed. You will need to first install the `permute` package.\n\n- Go to the R console window.\n- Run the command `> install.packages(\"permute\")`. \n\nYou will only need to run the `install.package()` command one time. You can now access `permute` anytime you like! However, you will need to run the command `library(permute)` during any R session in which you want to access data from the `permute` package.  **Be sure you have first installed the `permute` package before executing the code cell below.**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# be sure you have already installed the permute package\nlibrary(permute)  # loading permute package\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Summarizing and Storing the Data\n\n---\n\nIn the code cell below we load the `jackal` data from the `permute` package and provide a numerical summary of the two variables in the sample.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(jackal)  # load jackal data\nsummary(jackal)  # numerical summary of each variable\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     Length          Sex    \n Min.   :105.0   Male  :10  \n 1st Qu.:107.8   Female:10  \n Median :111.0              \n Mean   :111.0              \n 3rd Qu.:113.2              \n Max.   :120.0              \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe code cell below displays the distribution of mandible lengths separately for males and females.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# side by side box plots\nplot(Length ~ Sex, data = jackal, \n     col = c(\"dodgerblue\", \"mediumseagreen\"),\n     main = \"Mandible Length of Golden Jackals\",\n     ylab = \"Length (in mm)\")  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](16-Bootstrap-Dist_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe will be analyzing mandible lengths for both adult male and female golden jackals.

Any suggestions on how we can measure the uncertainty in our estimate due to the randomness of sampling?\n\n### Solution to Question 3\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n## What is a Statistical Question?\n\n---\n\nA <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**statistical question**</span> is one that can be answered by collecting data and where there will be variability in that data.\n\n> Based on a random sample of $n=20$ adult golden jackals, what is the mean mandible length of all adult golden jackals?\n\n- Each time we pick a different sample we have a different subset of data.\n- Different samples have different sample means, leading to different estimates.\n- **This is a statistical question!**\n- How can we account for this variability in our estimate?\n  \n> Using a database that contains information on all registered voters in Colorado, what proportion of all Colorado voters are over 50 years old?\n\n- The database includes information from the population of all registered voters in Colorado.\n- We can use the population data to calculate the proportion.\n- The population data does not change, so there is no variability in the value of the proportion.\n- **This is not an example of a statistical question.**\n\n# Bootstrapping: Sampling from a Sample\n\n---\n\nWe have explored the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**sampling distributions**</span> of [sample means](10-Sampling-Dist-Mean.qmd), [proportions](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd), [medians, variances](12-Sampling-Dist-Other.qmd) and other [estimators](15-Properties-Estimators.qmd) as a tool to assess the variability in those statistics and measure the level of uncertainty or precision in the estimate we obtain from the sample. In particular, the variance of a sampling distribution or the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**standard error**</span> (which is the square root of the variance of a sampling distribution) are commonly used to assess the variability in sample statistics.\n\nIn the case of the mean mandible length of all golden jackals, we have collected one sample of $n=20$ adult golden jackals. We do not have access to data from the entire population, so we cannot construct a sampling distribution by picking many different random samples each size $n=20$. Collecting unbiased samples can be quite expensive, time-consuming, and logistically difficult.  <span style=\"color:tomato\">**If we only have one sample and know very little about the population, how can we generate a sampling distribution from this limited information?**</span>\n\n\n## Bootstrap Distributions\n\n---\n\n<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Bootstrapping**</span> is the process of generating  many different random samples from one random sample to obtain an estimate for a population parameter. For each randomly selected resample, we calculate a statistic of interest. Then we construct a new distribution of bootstrap statistics that approximates a sampling distribution for some sample statistic (such as a mean, proportion, variance, and others).  We can use bootstrapping with any sample, even small ones. We can bootstrap any statistic. Thus, bootstrapping provides a robust method for performing statistical inference that we can adapt to many different situations in statistics and data science.\n\n### A Bootstrapping Algorithm\n\n---\n\nGiven an original sample of size $n$ from a population:\n\n1.  Draw a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**bootstrap resample**</span> of the same size, $n$, with replacement from the original sample.\n2.  Compute the relevant statistic (mean, proportion, max, variance, etc) of that sample.\n3.  Repeat this many times (say $100,\\!000$ times).\n\n-   A distribution of statistics from the bootstrap samples is called a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**bootstrap distribution**</span>.\n-   A bootstrap distribution gives an *approximation* for the sampling distribution.\n-   We can inspect the center, spread and shape of the bootstrap distribution and do statistical inference.\n\n\n## Question 4\n\n---\n\nConsider a random sample of 4 golden jackal mandible lengths (in mm):\n\n$$120, 107, 110, \\mbox{ and } 116.$$\n\nWhich of the following could be a possible bootstrap resample?

A bootstrap distribution is one example of a Monte Carlo method. A bootstrap distribution theoretically would contain the sample statistics from *all possible bootstrap resamples*. If we pick an initial sample size $n$, then there exists a total of $n^n$ possible bootstrap resamples. In the case of $n=20$, we have $20^{20} \\approx 1.049 \\times 10^{26}$ possible resamples. If we ignore the ordering in which we pick the sample, when $n=20$, we have a total of $68,\\!923,\\!264,\\!410$ (almost 69 billion!) distinct bootstrap resamples.\n\nFor small samples, we could write out all possible bootstrap resamples. For larger values of $n$ (and we see $n=20$ is already extremely large), it is really not practical or feasible to generate all possible bootstrap resamples while avoiding duplicates. Instead, we use Monte Carlo methods to repeatedly pick random samples that we use to approximate a sampling distribution. The Monte Carlo method of generating many (but necessarily all) bootstrap resamples introduces additional uncertainty and variability into the analysis. The more bootstrap resamples we choose, the less uncertainty we have.\n\n- By default, we will create $N =100,\\!000 = 10^5$ bootstrap resamples.\n- In some cases (very large $n$), we may choose a smaller number of resamples for the sake of time.\n- For typically bootstrapping, it is recommended to use at least $N=10,\\!000$ bootstrap resamples.\n\nMonte Carlo methods were first explored by the Polish mathematician Stanislow Ulam in the 1940s while working on the initial development of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico. The research required evaluating extremely challenging integrals. Ulam devised a numerical algorithm based on resampling to approximate the integrals. The method was later named \"Monte Carlo\", a gambling region in Monaco, due to the randomness involved in the computations.\n\n\n## Creating a Bootstrap Distribution in R {#sec-jawboot}\n\n---\n\nLet's return to our statistical question:\n\n> What is the average mandible (jaw) length of all golden jackals?\n\n\nWe have already picked one random sample of $n=20$ adult golden jackals. The mandible lengths of our sample are stored in the vector `jaw.sample`.\n\n### Step 1: Pick a Bootstrap Resample\n\n---\n\nWe use the `sample()` function in R to pick a random sample of values out of the values in `jaw.sample`.\n\n- Notice the resample has size $n=20$, the same as the original sample.\n- We use the option `replace = TRUE` since we want to sample with replacement.\n- Running the code cell below creates one bootstrap resample stored in `temp.samp`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemp.samp <- sample(jaw.sample, size=20, replace = TRUE)  # sample with replacement\ntemp.samp  # print sample to screen\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 112 108 105 111 110 116 111 111 110 105 111 108 117 112 111 111 114 111 107\n[20] 110\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Statistic(s) from the Bootstrap Sample\n\n---\n\nIn the golden jackal mandible length example, we want to use information about the distribution of sample means to estimate a population mean. Thus, we calculate the mean of the bootstrap resample `temp.samp` that we picked in the previous code cell.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(temp.samp)  # mean of bootstrap resample\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 110.55\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Step 3: Repeat Over and Over Again\n\n---\n\nIn the code cell below, we repeat steps 1 and 2 over and over again. The sample means we calculate from each bootstrap resample are stored in a vector named `boot.dist`. Run the code cell below to generate a bootstrap distribution for the sample mean.\n\n- A <span style=\"color:tomato\">solid red line</span> marks the location of the <span style=\"color:tomato\">sample mean from the original sample</span>.\n- A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">dashed blue line</span> marks the location of the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">mean of the bootstrap distribution</span>.\n- A <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">solid green line</span> marks the location of <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">another published estimate for the population mean</span>^[Ali Louei Monfared, \"Macro-Anatomical Investigation of the Skull of Golden Jackal (Canis aureus) and its Clinical Application during Regional Anesthesia\",  *Global Veterinaria* 10 (5): 547-550, 2013.].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##########################\n# cell is ready to run\n# no need for edits\n##########################\nN <- 10^5  # Number of bootstrap samples\nboot.dist <- numeric(N)  # create vector to store bootstrap means\n\n# for loop that creates bootstrap dist\nfor (i in 1:N)\n{\n  x <- sample(jaw.sample, 20, replace = TRUE)  # pick a bootstrap resample\n  boot.dist[i] <- mean(x)  # compute mean of bootstrap resample\n}\n\n# plot bootstrap distribution\nhist(boot.dist,  \n     breaks=20, \n     xlab = \"x-bar, mandible length (in mm)\",\n     main = \"Bootstrap Distribution for Sample Mean (n=20)\")\n\n# red line at the observed sample mean\nabline(v = mean(jaw.sample), col = \"firebrick2\", lwd = 2, lty = 1)\n\n# blue line at the center of bootstrap dist\nabline(v = mean(boot.dist), col = \"blue\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\n\n# green line at the population mean, 112 mm\nabline(v = 112, col = \"mediumseagreen\", lwd = 2, lty = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](16-Bootstrap-Dist_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 6\n\n---\n\nWhat are the mean and standard error of the bootstrap distribution?

Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n### Solution to Question 8\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# A Central Limit Theorem Model {#sec-jawclt}\n\n---\n\nLet $X$ be the mandible length (in mm) of a randomly selected adult golden jackal. Based on the sample data in `jaw.sample`, we could come up with unbiased estimates for the population mean and population variance using:\n\n- $\\mu \\approx \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum x_i =$ `mean(jaw.sample)` $=111$ mm.\n- $\\sigma^2 \\approx s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 =$ `var(jaw.sample)` $=15.05$ mm^2^.\n- This gives $\\sigma \\approx s = \\sqrt{15.05} = 3.88$ mm.\n\nWe now have an estimate for the population, namely $X \\sim N(111, 3.88)$. We can apply the [Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for Means](10-Sampling-Dist-Mean.qmd) to construct another estimate for the sampling distribution. Although our sample size is relatively small ($n=20 < 30$), we can apply CLT in this situation since the population is assumed to be symmetric (normally distributed).\n\n\n## Question 9\n\n--- \n\nUsing the CLT with the population model $X \\sim N(111, 3.88)$, we can derive a theoretical model for the distribution of sample means for $n=20$. Using the CLT for means, give the mean and standard error for the sampling distribution for $\\overline{X}$. **How do your answers compare to approximations you found in [Question 6] using the bootstrap distribution to estimate the sampling distribution for sample means?**\n\n\n### Solution to Question 9\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# Comparison of Bootstrap Approximations to CLT \n\n---\n\nConsider the theoretical population $X \\sim N(23,7)$.

For example, if we do not know the population mean $\\mu$, the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is a nice, unbiased substitute. If a population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is unknown, we can use substitute the sample standard deviation, $s$.\n\n- Bootstrapping is an extreme application of this principle.\n- We replace the entire population (not just one parameter) by the entire set of data from the sample.\n\nEach bootstrap resample is picked from the same \"population\", the original sample, to generate a bootstrap distribution that can be used to estimate a sampling distribution constructed from the entire population.\n\n# Properties of Bootstrap Estimators\n\n---\n\n- The goal of a bootstrap distribution is to estimate a sampling distribution for some statistic.\n- Bootstrap distributions are <span style=\"color:tomato\">**biased estimators for a population mean**</span> since they are centered near $\\bar{x}$ not necessarily $\\mu$.\n  - Thus, the mean of a bootstrap distribution is not useful alone.\n  - But bootstrapping is useful at quantifying the behavior of a parameter estimate.\n- For most common statistics, bootstrap distributions provide good estimates for the true <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**spread**</span>, <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**shape**</span>, and <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**bias**</span> of a sampling distribution for the statistic of interest.\n\n## Question 11: Arsenic Case Study\n\n---\n\nArsenic is a naturally occurring element in the groundwater in Bangladesh.\nMuch of this water is used for drinking in rural areas, so arsenic poisoning is a serious health issue.\nThe data set `Bangladesh` in the `resampledata` package^[Laura M.

We can generate a sampling distribution by simulating the selection of many different random samples from the population data, and we can compute the standard error of the sampling distribution to measure how much uncertainty we can expect due to the randomness of sampling. If we have access to data from the entire population, there is no need for statistics to estimate parameters since we know the values of the parameters! Recall the distinction and connection and between parameters and statistics:\n\n- A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**parameter**</span> is a characteristic of a population (which may be a probability distribution).\n  - The values of population parameters are unknown, but their values are fixed and not random.\n- A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**statistic**</span> is a characteristic of a sample that we can use to approximate a parameter.\n  - Statistics are not fixed values. They will vary due to the randomness of sampling.\n- Recall we use different notation for parameters and statistics.\n  - We typically use $\\theta$ to denote a generic population parameter.\n  - We use <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**hat notation**</span>, $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\hat{\\theta}}$, to denote estimators of $\\theta$.\n\nIn some situations, we have a known probability distribution that we can use to build a model and make predictions. For example, characteristics such as height ([normal](08-Common-Continuous-Distributions.qmd#sec-append-normal)), time between successive events ([exponential](08-Common-Continuous-Distributions.qmd#sec-append-exp)), and counting the number of times an event occurs over an interval of time all behave predictably ([Poisson](07-Common-Discrete-RandVar.qmd#sec-append-pois)). We can pick random sample and use point estimators such as [MLE](13-Estimation-MLE.qmd) and [MoM](14-Estimation-MOM.qmd) to estimate unknown population parameters. *What happens if the data does not follow a known distribution?*\n\n\nSuppose we would like to estimate the value of a parameter for a population about which we know very little information (this is often the case). We collect data from a single random sample of size $n$, and then we can use statistics from the sample to make predictions about the population:\n\n- To estimate a population mean, it makes practical and [mathematical sense to use a sample mean](15-Properties-Estimators.qmd#sec-mean-eff).\n- To estimate a population proportion, the sample proportion is an [unbiased estimator](15-Properties-Estimators.qmd#sec-prop-bias).\n- To estimate a population variance, we can use the [unbiased estimator](15-Properties-Estimators.qmd#sec-var-bias) $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$.\n\nIn any of these cases, how certain can/should we be in our estimate? In practice, we do not repeatedly pick 1000's of random samples from the population. That is likely impractical, expensive, and time consuming. We have only collected data from a single random sample.\n\n> <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**How can we account for the uncertainty in our estimate if we only have one random sample?**</span>\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\n::: {layout=\"[[55,45]]\" #fig-jackal}\n\n![Credit: Вых Пыхманн, [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0), Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Golden_jackal_-_portrait.jpg){fig-alt=\"Golden Jackal Portrait\"}\n\n![Mariomassone, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Grey_wolf_%26_golden_jackal_mandibles.jpg){fig-alt=\"Wolf and Jackal Mandible Bones\"}\n\nLeft: Golden Jackal (Canis aureus) Right: Mandible bones of wolf and jackal\n:::\n\n\nA zoologist would like to answer the following question?\n\n> What is the average mandible (jaw) length of all golden jackals (Canis aureus)?\n\nDevise a method for collecting and analyzing data to help them answer this question.\n\n\n### Solution to Question 1\n\n---\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# Case Study: Golden Jackal Mandible Length\n\n---\n\nThe data frame^[Manly, B.F.J.

Chapman & Hall/CRC, Boca Raton.] `jackal` in the `permute` package contains a sample of $n=20$ mandibles from male and female golden jackals.

In particular, the variance of a sampling distribution or the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**standard error**</span> (which is the square root of the variance of a sampling distribution) are commonly used to assess the variability in sample statistics.\n\nIn the case of the mean mandible length of all golden jackals, we have collected one sample of $n=20$ adult golden jackals. We do not have access to data from the entire population, so we cannot construct a sampling distribution by picking many different random samples each size $n=20$. Collecting unbiased samples can be quite expensive, time-consuming, and logistically difficult.  <span style=\"color:tomato\">**If we only have one sample and know very little about the population, how can we generate a sampling distribution from this limited information?**</span>\n\n\n## Bootstrap Distributions\n\n---\n\n<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Bootstrapping**</span> is the process of generating  many different random samples from one random sample to obtain an estimate for a population parameter. For each randomly selected resample, we calculate a statistic of interest. Then we construct a new distribution of bootstrap statistics that approximates a sampling distribution for some sample statistic (such as a mean, proportion, variance, and others).  We can use bootstrapping with any sample, even small ones. We can bootstrap any statistic. Thus, bootstrapping provides a robust method for performing statistical inference that we can adapt to many different situations in statistics and data science.\n\n### A Bootstrapping Algorithm\n\n---\n\nGiven an original sample of size $n$ from a population:\n\n1.  Draw a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**bootstrap resample**</span> of the same size, $n$, with replacement from the original sample.\n2.  Compute the relevant statistic (mean, proportion, max, variance, etc) of that sample.\n3.  Repeat this many times (say $100,\\!000$ times).\n\n-   A distribution of statistics from the bootstrap samples is called a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**bootstrap distribution**</span>.\n-   A bootstrap distribution gives an *approximation* for the sampling distribution.\n-   We can inspect the center, spread and shape of the bootstrap distribution and do statistical inference.\n\n\n## Question 4\n\n---\n\nConsider a random sample of 4 golden jackal mandible lengths (in mm):\n\n$$120, 107, 110, \\mbox{ and } 116.$$\n\nWhich of the following could be a possible bootstrap resample?

A bootstrap distribution is one example of a Monte Carlo method. A bootstrap distribution theoretically would contain the sample statistics from *all possible bootstrap resamples*. If we pick an initial sample size $n$, then there exists a total of $n^n$ possible bootstrap resamples. In the case of $n=20$, we have $20^{20} \\approx 1.049 \\times 10^{26}$ possible resamples. If we ignore the ordering in which we pick the sample, when $n=20$, we have a total of $68,\\!923,\\!264,\\!410$ (almost 69 billion!) distinct bootstrap resamples.\n\nFor small samples, we could write out all possible bootstrap resamples. For larger values of $n$ (and we see $n=20$ is already extremely large), it is really not practical or feasible to generate all possible bootstrap resamples while avoiding duplicates. Instead, we use Monte Carlo methods to repeatedly pick random samples that we use to approximate a sampling distribution. The Monte Carlo method of generating many (but necessarily all) bootstrap resamples introduces additional uncertainty and variability into the analysis. The more bootstrap resamples we choose, the less uncertainty we have.\n\n- By default, we will create $N =100,\\!000 = 10^5$ bootstrap resamples.\n- In some cases (very large $n$), we may choose a smaller number of resamples for the sake of time.\n- For typically bootstrapping, it is recommended to use at least $N=10,\\!000$ bootstrap resamples.\n\nMonte Carlo methods were first explored by the Polish mathematician Stanislow Ulam in the 1940s while working on the initial development of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico. The research required evaluating extremely challenging integrals. Ulam devised a numerical algorithm based on resampling to approximate the integrals. The method was later named \"Monte Carlo\", a gambling region in Monaco, due to the randomness involved in the computations.\n\n\n## Creating a Bootstrap Distribution in R {#sec-jawboot}\n\n---\n\nLet's return to our statistical question:\n\n> What is the average mandible (jaw) length of all golden jackals?\n\n\nWe have already picked one random sample of $n=20$ adult golden jackals. The mandible lengths of our sample are stored in the vector `jaw.sample`.\n\n### Step 1: Pick a Bootstrap Resample\n\n---\n\nWe use the `sample()` function in R to pick a random sample of values out of the values in `jaw.sample`.\n\n- Notice the resample has size $n=20$, the same as the original sample.\n- We use the option `replace = TRUE` since we want to sample with replacement.\n- Running the code cell below creates one bootstrap resample stored in `temp.samp`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemp.samp <- sample(jaw.sample, size=20, replace = TRUE)  # sample with replacement\ntemp.samp  # print sample to screen\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 114 120 106 111 114 111 107 111 113 110 110 107 106 107 110 120 112 111 110\n[20] 110\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Statistic(s) from the Bootstrap Sample\n\n---\n\nIn the golden jackal mandible length example, we want to use information about the distribution of sample means to estimate a population mean. Thus, we calculate the mean of the bootstrap resample `temp.samp` that we picked in the previous code cell.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(temp.samp)  # mean of bootstrap resample\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 111\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Step 3: Repeat Over and Over Again\n\n---\n\nIn the code cell below, we repeat steps 1 and 2 over and over again. The sample means we calculate from each bootstrap resample are stored in a vector named `boot.dist`. Run the code cell below to generate a bootstrap distribution for the sample mean.\n\n- A <span style=\"color:tomato\">solid red line</span> marks the location of the <span style=\"color:tomato\">sample mean from the original sample</span>.\n- A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">dashed blue line</span> marks the location of the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">mean of the bootstrap distribution</span>.\n- A <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">solid green line</span> marks the location of <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">another published estimate for the population mean</span>^[Ali Louei Monfared, \"Macro-Anatomical Investigation of the Skull of Golden Jackal (Canis aureus) and its Clinical Application during Regional Anesthesia\",  *Global Veterinaria* 10 (5): 547-550, 2013.].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##########################\n# cell is ready to run\n# no need for edits\n##########################\nN <- 10^5  # Number of bootstrap samples\nboot.dist <- numeric(N)  # create vector to store bootstrap means\n\n# for loop that creates bootstrap dist\nfor (i in 1:N)\n{\n  x <- sample(jaw.sample, 20, replace = TRUE)  # pick a bootstrap resample\n  boot.dist[i] <- mean(x)  # compute mean of bootstrap resample\n}\n\n# plot bootstrap distribution\nhist(boot.dist,  \n     breaks=20, \n     xlab = \"x-bar, mandible length (in mm)\",\n     main = \"Bootstrap Distribution for Sample Mean (n=20)\")\n\n# red line at the observed sample mean\nabline(v = mean(jaw.sample), col = \"firebrick2\", lwd = 2, lty = 1)\n\n# blue line at the center of bootstrap dist\nabline(v = mean(boot.dist), col = \"blue\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\n\n# green line at the population mean, 112 mm\nabline(v = 112, col = \"mediumseagreen\", lwd = 2, lty = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](16-Bootstrap-Dist_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 6\n\n---\n\nWhat are the mean and standard error of the bootstrap distribution?

Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n### Solution to Question 8\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# A Central Limit Theorem Model {#sec-jawclt}\n\n---\n\nLet $X$ be the mandible length (in mm) of a randomly selected adult golden jackal. Based on the sample data in `jaw.sample`, we could come up with unbiased estimates for the population mean and population variance using:\n\n- $\\mu \\approx \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum x_i =$ `mean(jaw.sample)` $=111$ mm.\n- $\\sigma^2 \\approx s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 =$ `var(jaw.sample)` $=15.05$ mm^2^.\n- This gives $\\sigma \\approx s = \\sqrt{15.05} = 3.88$ mm.\n\nWe now have an estimate for the population, namely $X \\sim N(111, 3.88)$. We can apply the [Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for Means](10-Sampling-Dist-Mean.qmd) to construct another estimate for the sampling distribution. Although our sample size is relatively small ($n=20 < 30$), we can apply CLT in this situation since the population is assumed to be symmetric (normally distributed).\n\n\n## Question 9\n\n--- \n\nUsing the CLT with the population model $X \\sim N(111, 3.88)$, we can derive a theoretical model for the distribution of sample means for $n=20$. Using the CLT for means, give the mean and standard error for the sampling distribution for $\\overline{X}$. **How do your answers compare to approximations you found in [Question 6] using the bootstrap distribution to estimate the sampling distribution for sample means?**\n\n\n### Solution to Question 9\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# Comparison of Bootstrap Approximations to CLT \n\n---\n\nConsider the theoretical population $X \\sim N(23,7)$.

Compare the population and sample distributions. What is similar about the two distributions? What are the differences?\n\n<br>  \n\nb.  Compare the CLT sampling distribution and bootstrap sampling distribution. What is similar about the two distributions? What are the differences?\n\n### Solution to Question 10\n\n---\n\nSolution to part a:  \n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\nSolution to part b:  \n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n## The Plug-in Principle {#sec-plugin}\n\n---\n\n<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**The Plug-in Principle:**</span> If something (such as a characteristic of a population) is unknown, substitute (plug-in) an estimate. For example, if we do not know the population mean $\\mu$, the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is a nice, unbiased substitute. If a population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is unknown, we can use substitute the sample standard deviation, $s$.\n\n- Bootstrapping is an extreme application of this principle.\n- We replace the entire population (not just one parameter) by the entire set of data from the sample.\n\nEach bootstrap resample is picked from the same \"population\", the original sample, to generate a bootstrap distribution that can be used to estimate a sampling distribution constructed from the entire population.\n\n# Properties of Bootstrap Estimators\n\n---\n\n- The goal of a bootstrap distribution is to estimate a sampling distribution for some statistic.\n- Bootstrap distributions are <span style=\"color:tomato\">**biased estimators for a population mean**</span> since they are centered near $\\bar{x}$ not necessarily $\\mu$.\n  - Thus, the mean of a bootstrap distribution is not useful alone.\n  - But bootstrapping is useful at quantifying the behavior of a parameter estimate.\n- For most common statistics, bootstrap distributions provide good estimates for the true <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**spread**</span>, <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**shape**</span>, and <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**bias**</span> of a sampling distribution for the statistic of interest.\n\n## Question 11: Arsenic Case Study\n\n---\n\nArsenic is a naturally occurring element in the groundwater in Bangladesh.\nMuch of this water is used for drinking in rural areas, so arsenic poisoning is a serious health issue.\nThe data set `Bangladesh` in the `resampledata` package^[Laura M. Chihara and Tim C. Hesterberg (2019) *Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R*. Second Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ.] contains measurements on arsenic, chlorine, and cobalt levels (in parts per billion, ppb) present in each of 271 groundwater samples.\n\n\n### Loading the Data\n\n---\n\nIt is very likely you do not have the package `resampledata` installed. You will need to first install the `resampledata` package.\n\n- Go to the R console.\n- Run the command `> install.packages(\"resampledata\")`. \n\nYou will only need to run the `install.package()` command one time. You can now access `resampledata` anytime you like!
