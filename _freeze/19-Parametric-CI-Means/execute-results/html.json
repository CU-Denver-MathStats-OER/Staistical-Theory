Statistics such as means and proportions are linear combinations of random variables, and using [theory from probability](06-Expected-Value-and-Variance.qmd#sec-prop-exp), we are able the derive the [Central Limit Theorem (CLT) formulas](10-Sampling-Dist-Mean.qmd#sec-cltmeans) to model sampling distributions for means and proportions. In this section we will construct confidence intervals by applying a *parametric* approach that uses formulas from the CLT to measure the uncertainty (standard error) in our estimate.\n\n- With <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**parametric methods**</span>, we perform inference using formulas derived from theory to model the shape, center and spread of sampling distributions.\n- Monte Carlo methods such as bootstrap resampling are non-parametric since they use simulations to estimate sampling distributions.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nFor statistics that are not linear combinations of independent random variables (such as medians, variances, and ratios of means) deriving formulas to model the sampling distribution is more complicated or not even possible. We can try [bootstrapping in these situations](18-Bootstrap-Other-Stats.qmd) instead!\n:::\n\n\n# Case Study: Average Wind Speed of Storms {#sec-storm}\n\n---\n\n\n![Credit: WikiImages, CC0 via [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/hurricane-cyclone-typhoon-wind-58025/)](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/09/26/17/26/winter-storm-58025_1280.jpg){fig-align=\"left\" width=45% fig-alt=\"Satellite Image of Hurricane\"}\n\n\nSuppose a climatologist has contacted us for help estimating the average wind speed of all storms in the North Atlantic. They have collected a random sample of $n=36$ wind speeds from North Atlantic storms over the past 5 years.\n\n## Loading Storms Data\n\n---\n\nWhen practicing [exploratory data analysis earlier](03-EDA-Quantitative.qmd#sec-storms), we accessed the `dplyr` package that contains a data set from the [NOAA Hurricane Best Track Data](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat){target=\"_blank\"}, called `storms`, with data on many different storm attributes. We will begin analyzing the variable `wind` that gives the wind speed in knots. Run the code cell below to: \n\n- Load the `dplyr` package (which should already be installed), and \n- Store the wind speeds to a new vector called `population`.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIf you receive an error message when running the code cell below, then you may not have the `dplyr` package installed. \n\n- In the R console, run the command `install.packages(\"dplyr\")`.\n- Then rerun the code cell below.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\npopulation <- storms$wind\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Picking a Random Sample of Storms\n\n---\n\nWhen performing statistical inference, we do not have complete data from the entire population. We typically have data from one sample picked randomly from the population. Based on the sample data, we try to estimate unknown parameters for the population. To begin our exploration of confidence intervals, suppose the 19066 wind speeds in the `population` data represents the full population of all storms at all times in the North Atlantic. We investigate the following statistical question:\n\n> <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">What is the average wind speed of all storms in the North Atlantic, $\\mu_{\\rm{wind}}$?</span>\n\n- Assume we do not have access to all the `population` data and cannot directly calculate $\\mu_{\\rm{wind}}$.\n- We will pick one random sample of 36 wind speeds from the `population`.\n- We will use our sample to estimate the mean wind speed of all storms in the North Atlantic.\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\n\nPick a random sample of $n=36$ wind speeds from the `population`.

If the two answers are different, which confidence interval do you believe is more accurate?\n\n\n### Solution to Question 14\n\n---\n\nComplete the command below and then compare result to answer in [Question 13c].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(??, ??, conf.level = ??)$conf.int\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n## Subsetting with `t.test`\n\n---\n\nFrequently, we would like to compare the distributions of a quantitative variable, denoted `quant`, for two different groups based on a categorical variable in the data set, denoted `categorical`. If our sample data is stored in a data frame called `data.name` with this structure, we can use `t.test()` without having to first split the sample into independent samples according to category group. `t.test()` can subset the data into independent samples for us and construct a confidence interval for the difference in two means. Using the `t.test()` function \n\n<center>\n`t.test(quant ~ categorical, data = data.name, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int` \n</center>\n\n<br> \nwill give a 95% confidence level for the difference in means of a specified quantitative variable between the two different groups of the categorical variable.\n\n\n## Question 15\n\n---\n\nThe code cell below subsets the sample data for all months in `storms` to a new data frame named `pooled` that:\n\n- Includes only storm observations from September or October.\n- Selects only two variables, `wind` and `month`, to keep from `storms`.\n- The first six rows of the data frame `pooled` are printed to the screen with `head(pooled)`.\n- Run the code cell below and inspect the first six rows of `pooled`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npooled <- subset(storms,\n               month == \"9\" | month == \"10\",   # month is 9 OR month is 10\n               select = c(wind, month))  # select wind and month variables\n\nhead(pooled)  # print first 6 rows of pooled to screen\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n   wind month\n  <int> <fct>\n1    30 9    \n2    20 9    \n3    20 9    \n4    75 9    \n5    75 9    \n6    75 9    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nUse the `t.test()` function with the pooled sample `pooled` to construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean wind speeds of North Atlantic storms in September compared to October. How does your answer compare to your confidence intervals in [Question 13c] and [Question 14]? If the intervals are different, which confidence interval do you believe is most accurate?\n\n\n### Solution to Question 15\n\n---\n\nComplete the command below and then compare the result to your answers in [Question 13c] and [Question 14].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(?? ~ ??, data = ??, conf.level = ??)$conf.int\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n## Caution Using `t.test()` for a Difference in Two Means\n\n---\n\n\nThe variable `month` in the original sample `storms` has observations from **10 different months**. If you try running the command `t.test(wind ~ month, data = storms, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int` you will receive an error since the categorical variable `month` has more than two classes. <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**The categorical variable used to split the data must have exactly 2 different classes**</span>. In solving [Question 15] we avoided this error by: \n\n- First creating the `pooled` sample that included only two months, September and October.\n- Then using `t.test()` with the `pooled` sample instead of the full `storms` data set.\n\n\nOtherwise, we can split the original sample into two independent samples `x` and `y` and use the `t.test()` function as we did in [Question 14] with independent wind speed samples `sep.wind` and `oct.wind`.\n\n\n---\n\n![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png) <nbsp>\n\n*Statistical Methods: Exploring the Uncertain* by [Adam Spiegler](https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n\n",
