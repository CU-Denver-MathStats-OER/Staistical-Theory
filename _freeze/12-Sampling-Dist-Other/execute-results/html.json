In addition to being useful summaries of data, both means and proportions are linear combinations of independent random variables. \n\n-   If $X_1, X_2, \\ldots , X_n$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables (independently selected from the same population), then the sample mean is a linear combination of random variables,\n\n$$\\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \\ldots + X_n}{n}.$$\n\n-   If $X \\sim \\mbox{Binom}(n, p)$, then the sample proportion is a multiple of one random variable,\n\n$$\\widehat{P} = \\frac{X}{n}.$$ \n\n\nThus for proportions and means, we can derive the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to describe the mean and standard error (spread) of sampling distributions by applying [properties of expected value and variance of independent random variables](06-Expected-Value-and-Variance.qmd#sec-prop-exp):\n\n$$E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y) \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad \\mbox{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\\mbox{Var}(X) + b^2 \\mbox{Var}(Y).$$\n\n\n\nThere many other statistics that may be more relevant to study to other situations. Generalizing sampling distributions to other statistics will allow us to explore a bigger variety of  questions.  Even if we cannot derive formulas that describe the mean and variance of other sampling distributions, we can construct a sampling distribution using a simulation. Sometimes simulations bring to light patterns and conjectures that we can try to verify and prove analytically.\n\n\n# Simulation for Sampling Distributions\n\n---\n\n![Credit: [Light Rail Train Denver](https://pixabay.com/photos/light-rail-train-denver-colorado-4793556/), [Open Content License](https://pixabay.com/service/terms/), by [Lorencosmic22](https://pixabay.com/users/lorencosmic22-12392680/) via pixabay](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/01/25/23/12/light-rail-train-4793556_1280.jpg){fig-align=\"left\" width=50% fig-alt=\"Light Rail Train in Denver\"} <nbsp>\n\nWe can apply the same method as we used with constructing sampling distributions for [means](10-Sampling-Dist-Mean.qmd) and [proportions](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd) to create a sampling distribution for any statistic. The general process is as follows:\n\n1. Pick a random sample size $n$ from population $X$.\n2. Calculate some statistic(s) of interest from the sample.\n3. Repeat. Generate many random samples (each size $n$) and calculate the statistic(s) of interest from each sample.\n\n\nWe [previsouly considered the sampling distribution for the mean wait time between trains](10-Sampling-Dist-Mean.qmd#sec-train). In that example, the wait time between trains was exponentially distributed with a mean of $4$ minutes between trains. Thus, the rate parameter is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{4}$. We sample from the population of $Y \\sim \\mbox{Exp} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)$ which is skewed to the right.\n\nRun the code cell below to create a sampling distribution for the mean time between trains with samples size $n=50$.\n\n- We will generate 10,000 random samples, and the mean of each will be stored in the vector `samp.mean`.\n- The for loop includes the steps for creating a sampling distribution:\n  -  Pick a random sample stored in `time.sample` using `rexp(50, 1/4)`.\n  - Calculate the mean of the sample with `mean(time.sample)`.\n- No output is printed to screen after running the code cell below since the values are being stored in `samp.mean`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# creates an empty vector to store results\nsamp.mean <- numeric(10000)\n\n# a for loop that generates 10000 random samples \n# each size n=50, and calculates the sample mean.\nfor (i in 1:10000)\n{\n  time.sample <- rexp(50, 1/4)  # Step 1: Randomly picks 50 values from Exp(1/4)\n  samp.mean[i] <- mean(time.sample)  # Step 2: calculate sample mean\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Graphical Summary of Results of Simulation\n\n--- \n\nRun the code cell below to generate side-by-side plots of the pdf of the population $Y \\sim \\mbox{Exp}(1/4)$ and a sampling distribution for the mean with $n=50$.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))  # arrange plots side by side\n\n# plot population\ny <- seq(0, 6, 0.01) \nplot(y, dexp(y), type = \"l\",\n     xlab = \"Y, wait time (in min)\",\n     main = \"Population, Y ~ Exp(1/4)\")\n\n# plot the sampling distribution of means\nhist(samp.mean, \n     breaks = 20,\n     xlab = \"Mean Wait Time (n=50)\",\n     main = \"Dist. of Sample Means\")\nabline(v = mean(samp.mean), col = \"blue\", lwd = 2)  # center of sampling dist of mean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-Sampling-Dist-Other_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Simulation for Sampling Distribution for Median\n\n---\n\nSince wait times between trains are skewed to the right, the sample means will be more heavily influenced by outliers that are biased to the right. The median is the 50th percentile of the data, and it is not as sensitive to outliers. We might want to consider a sampling distribution for the median if we want to consider a measure of center that is less influenced by outliers.\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\nComplete the partially completed code cell below to generate a sampling distribution for the **median** weight time between trains using samples size $n=50$.

What quantity is the blue line representing?\n- Compare the locations of the two lines. Why is the blue line to the right of the red line?

If we pick a random sample of values $X_1, X_2, \\ldots , X_n$ from a population, it is natural to consider how much variation can we expect in the spread of values (measured by variance) for different random samples of size $n$. The variance is not a linear combination of random variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots , X_n$, so we cannot use the same properties of expected value and variance that we applied to derive the Central Limit Theorem for means and proportions. Instead, we will use a simulation based method to investigate properties of a sampling distribution for sample variances.\n\n\n## Question 4\n\n---\n\nCholesterol is a fat-like substance present in all cells in your body.  A blood test is used to measure\ncholesterol levels. The distribution of cholesterol levels for adults age 20 or older is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 200 mg/dL and standard deviation 40 mg/dL. Let $X$ be the cholesterol level of a randomly selected adult age 20 or above. Thus, we have $X \\sim N(200, 40)$.\n\n### Question 4a\n\n---\n\nComplete the partially completed code cell below to generate a sampling distribution for the **sample variance** of cholesterol level using samples size $n=25$.\n\n#### Solution to Question 4a\n\n---\n\nReplace each of the three `??` in the code cell below with appropriate code.

We can always use simulations to approximate sampling distributions, even if we do not have a formal theorem or formulas that describe the distribution for those sample statistics. With some statistics, such as sample means and sample proportions, we can use properties of random variables to derive theory and formulas that describe properties of the sampling distribution. In situations where we can theoretically model sampling distributions, technology is not required to describe the sampling distribution. We explore some additional statistics, namely the maximum of a sample, and derive formulas we can use to describe a sampling distribution of maximum values.\n\n\n\n\n## Sampling Distribution for the Maximum\n\n---\n\n\nFrequently we are interested in the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**sample maximum value**</span>, denoted $\\color{dodgerblue}{X_{\\rm{max}}}$, of a random sample. For example, if we pick a random sample of five values, $\\left\\{ 11, 18, 2, 31, 25 \\right\\}$, then we have the statistics $X_{\\rm{min}} = 2$ and $X_{\\rm{max}} = 31$. A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**sampling distribution for the sample maximum**</span> would be the distribution of maximum values obtained from samples when we independently pick many random samples, each size $n$, from the same population.\n\n\n## Question 5\n\n---\n\nLet $F$ denote the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for a continuous random variable $X$. Derive the cdf for $X_{\\rm{max}}$, the maximum of a random sample $X_1,X_2, \\ldots, X_n$, with each $X_i$ independently picked from the same population $X$ that has cdf $F(x)$.\n\nAn outline of a proof is provided below. In the solution space below, fill in missing explanations for each step of the proof.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nF_{X_{\\rm{max}}} (a) &= P(X_1 \\leq a, X_2 \\leq a, \\ldots, X_n \\leq a) & \\mbox{Explanation 1} \\\\\n&= P\\big( (X_1 \\leq a) \\cap (X_2 \\leq a) \\cap \\ldots \\cap (X_n \\leq a) \\big) & \\mbox{Explanation 2}\\\\\n&= P(X_1 \\leq a) \\cdot P(X_2 \\leq a) \\cdot  \\ldots  \\cdot P(X_n \\leq a) & \\mbox{Explanation 3}\\\\\n&= F(a) \\cdot F(a) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot F(a) & \\mbox{Explanation 4}\\\\\n&= \\big( F(a) \\big)^n\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n\n### Solution to Question 5\n\n---\n\n**Explanation 1:**\n\n<br>  \n\n**Explanation 2:**\n\n<br>  \n\n**Explanation 3:**\n\n<br>  \n\n**Explanation 4:**\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n## Question 6\n\n---\n\nUsing the result from the previous problem, find\n$\\displaystyle f_{X_{\\rm{max}}} (a)$, the probability density function (pdf) for the maximum of a\nrandom sample. Your answer will depend on both $F$ and $f$, the\ncorresponding cdf and pdf, respectively, of $X$.\n\n*Hint: Recall the general relation between cdf’s and pdf’s of continuous random variables.*\n\n### Solution to Question 6\n\n---\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### Summarizing Results for $X_{\\rm{max}}$ {#sec-sum-max}\n\n---\n\nLet $F$ denote the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for a\ncontinuous random variable $X$, and let $X_{\\rm{max}}$ denote the maximum of a random sample $X_1,X_2, \\ldots, X_n$, where each $X_i$ is independently picked from population $X$. Then the sample maximum, $X_{\\rm{max}}$, will have:\n\n-   <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">Cumulative distribution function $\\displaystyle F_{X_{\\rm{max}}} (a) = \\big( F(a) \\big)^n$.</span>\n-   <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">Probability density function $\\displaystyle f_{X_{\\rm{max}}} (a) = n \\left( F(a) \\right)^{n-1} f(a)$.</span>\n\n\n## Question 7\n\n---\n\nLet $X$ be a random variable with continuous uniform distribution $\\mbox{Unif}(0,1)$.

The program has come under scrutiny in many cities regarding claims of racial-profiling. We investigate the following question:\n\n> Does the stop-and-frisk program in New York City seem to profile people based on race?\n\nIn 2022, 15,102 stops were recorded by NYPD, and these stops are broken down by race in the table below.\n\n| Race | 2022 NYPD Stops^[Data from [(NYPD Stop, Ask, and Frisk Data 2022](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page)] | NYC Population^[Data from [US Census Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/newyorkcitynewyork)] |\n|------|------------|------------------|\n| Black | 8,863 | $0.23$ |\n| Latinx | 4,477 | $0.29$ |\n| White | 1,077 | $0.32$ | \n| Asian/Pacific Islander | 320 | $0.14$ |\n| Mixed/Other | 365 | $0.02$ |\n| Total | 15102 | 1 |\n\n-   In the code cell below, we save the data in the table to two vectors `observe` and `prop`.\n-   Be sure to run the code cell below in order to answer the questions that follow.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobserve <- c(8863, 4477, 1077, 320, 365)  # vector of observed values\nprop <- c(0.23, 0.29, 0.32, 0.14, 0.02)  # vector of population proportions\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the jury example from our exploration with [sampling distributions for a single proportion](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd), we considered whether people that identify their political party as Independent have fair representation. Political party was a binary variable (Independent or Not). Perhaps a more useful question to explore is whether the jury has a good representation of all political affiliations, not just Independents. When working with a categorical variable that has more than two categories, such as race or political affiliation, we need to consider more than a single proportion. Rather than consider a single proportion, we can conduct a  <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**chi-square goodness-of-fit test**</span> to measure how well the random sample resembles the population as far as what proportion of observations are in each category. We assume the categories are mutually exclusive (an observation cannot belong to multiple categories), and thus the sum of all proportions is 1.\n\n## Question 10\n\n---\n\nThis question guides us through the calculation of a statistic to measure how well racial demographics of the people stopped by NYPD in 2022 match the overall racial demographics of NYC in 2022.\n\n\n### Question 10a\n\n---\n\nFirst, we calculate the **expected** totals for each racial category.

In addition to being useful summaries of data, both means and proportions are linear combinations of independent random variables. \n\n-   If $X_1, X_2, \\ldots , X_n$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables (independently selected from the same population), then the sample mean is a linear combination of random variables,\n\n$$\\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \\ldots + X_n}{n}.$$\n\n-   If $X \\sim \\mbox{Binom}(n, p)$, then the sample proportion is a multiple of one random variable,\n\n$$\\widehat{P} = \\frac{X}{n}.$$ \n\n\nThus for proportions and means, we can derive the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to describe the mean and standard error (spread) of sampling distributions by applying [properties of expected value and variance of independent random variables](06-Expected-Value-and-Variance.qmd#sec-prop-exp){target=\"_blank\"}:\n\n$$E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y) \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad \\mbox{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\\mbox{Var}(X) + b^2 \\mbox{Var}(Y).$$\n\n\n\nThere many other statistics that may be more relevant to study to other situations. Generalizing sampling distributions to other statistics will allow us to explore a bigger variety of  questions.  Even if we cannot derive formulas that describe the mean and variance of other sampling distributions, we can construct a sampling distribution using a simulation. Sometimes simulations bring to light patterns and conjectures that we can try to verify and prove analytically.\n\n\n# Simulation for Sampling Distributions\n\n---\n\n![Credit: [Light Rail Train Denver](https://pixabay.com/photos/light-rail-train-denver-colorado-4793556/), [Open Content License](https://pixabay.com/service/terms/), by [Lorencosmic22](https://pixabay.com/users/lorencosmic22-12392680/) via pixabay](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/01/25/23/12/light-rail-train-4793556_1280.jpg){fig-align=\"left\" width=50% fig-alt=\"Light Rail Train in Denver\"} <nbsp>\n\nWe can apply the same method as we used with constructing sampling distributions for [means](10-Sampling-Dist-Mean.qmd){target=\"_blank\"} and [proportions](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd){target=\"_blank\"} to create a sampling distribution for any statistic. The general process is as follows:\n\n1. Pick a random sample size $n$ from population $X$.\n2. Calculate some statistic(s) of interest from the sample.\n3. Repeat. Generate many random samples (each size $n$) and calculate the statistic(s) of interest from each sample.\n\n\nWe [previsouly considered the sampling distribution for the mean wait time between trains](10-Sampling-Dist-Mean.qmd#sec-train){target=\"_blank\"}. In that example, the wait time between trains was exponentially distributed with a mean of $4$ minutes between trains. Thus, the rate parameter is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{4}$. We sample from the population of $Y \\sim \\mbox{Exp} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)$ which is skewed to the right.\n\nRun the code cell below to create a sampling distribution for the mean time between trains with samples size $n=50$.\n\n- We will generate 10,000 random samples, and the mean of each will be stored in the vector `samp.mean`.\n- The for loop includes the steps for creating a sampling distribution:\n  -  Pick a random sample stored in `time.sample` using `rexp(50, 1/4)`.\n  - Calculate the mean of the sample with `mean(time.sample)`.\n- No output is printed to screen after running the code cell below since the values are being stored in `samp.mean`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# creates an empty vector to store results\nsamp.mean <- numeric(10000)\n\n# a for loop that generates 10000 random samples \n# each size n=50, and calculates the sample mean.\nfor (i in 1:10000)\n{\n  time.sample <- rexp(50, 1/4)  # Step 1: Randomly picks 50 values from Exp(1/4)\n  samp.mean[i] <- mean(time.sample)  # Step 2: calculate sample mean\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Graphical Summary of Results of Simulation\n\n--- \n\nRun the code cell below to generate side-by-side plots of the pdf of the population $Y \\sim \\mbox{Exp}(1/4)$ and a sampling distribution for the mean with $n=50$.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))  # arrange plots side by side\n\n# plot population\ny <- seq(0, 6, 0.01) \nplot(y, dexp(y), type = \"l\",\n     xlab = \"Y, wait time (in min)\",\n     main = \"Population, Y ~ Exp(1/4)\")\n\n# plot the sampling distribution of means\nhist(samp.mean, \n     breaks = 20,\n     xlab = \"Mean Wait Time (n=50)\",\n     main = \"Dist. of Sample Means\")\nabline(v = mean(samp.mean), col = \"blue\", lwd = 2)  # center of sampling dist of mean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-Sampling-Dist-Other_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Simulation for Sampling Distribution for Median\n\n---\n\nSince wait times between trains are skewed to the right, the sample means will be more heavily influenced by outliers that are biased to the right. The median is the 50th percentile of the data, and it is not as sensitive to outliers. We might want to consider a sampling distribution for the median if we want to consider a measure of center that is less influenced by outliers.\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\nComplete the partially completed code cell below to generate a sampling distribution for the **median** weight time between trains using samples size $n=50$.

If we pick a random sample of values $X_1, X_2, \\ldots , X_n$ from a population, it is natural to consider how much variation can we expect in the spread of values (measured by variance) for different random samples of size $n$. The variance is not a linear combination of random variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots , X_n$, so we cannot use the same properties of expected value and variance that we applied to derive the Central Limit Theorem for means and proportions. Instead, we will use a simulation based method to investigate properties of a sampling distribution for sample variances.\n\n\n## Question 4\n\n---\n\nCholesterol is a fat-like substance present in all cells in your body.  A blood test is used to measure\ncholesterol levels. The distribution of cholesterol levels for adults age 20 or older is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 200 mg/dL and standard deviation 40 mg/dL. Let $X$ be the cholesterol level of a randomly selected adult age 20 or above. Thus, we have $X \\sim N(200, 40)$.\n\n### Question 4a\n\n---\n\nComplete the partially completed code cell below to generate a sampling distribution for the **sample variance** of cholesterol level using samples size $n=25$.\n\n#### Solution to Question 4a\n\n---\n\nReplace each of the three `??` in the code cell below with appropriate code.

We can always use simulations to approximate sampling distributions, even if we do not have a formal theorem or formulas that describe the distribution for those sample statistics. With some statistics, such as sample means and sample proportions, we can use properties of random variables to derive theory and formulas that describe properties of the sampling distribution. In situations where we can theoretically model sampling distributions, technology is not required to describe the sampling distribution. We explore some additional statistics, namely the maximum of a sample, and derive formulas we can use to describe a sampling distribution of maximum values.\n\n\n\n\n## Sampling Distribution for the Maximum\n\n---\n\n\nFrequently we are interested in the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**sample maximum value**</span>, denoted $\\color{dodgerblue}{X_{\\rm{max}}}$, of a random sample. For example, if we pick a random sample of five values, $\\left\\{ 11, 18, 2, 31, 25 \\right\\}$, then we have the statistics $X_{\\rm{min}} = 2$ and $X_{\\rm{max}} = 31$. A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**sampling distribution for the sample maximum**</span> would be the distribution of maximum values obtained from samples when we independently pick many random samples, each size $n$, from the same population.\n\n\n## Question 5\n\n---\n\nLet $F$ denote the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for a continuous random variable $X$. Derive the cdf for $X_{\\rm{max}}$, the maximum of a random sample $X_1,X_2, \\ldots, X_n$, with each $X_i$ independently picked from the same population $X$ that has cdf $F(x)$.\n\nAn outline of a proof is provided below. In the solution space below, fill in missing explanations for each step of the proof.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nF_{X_{\\rm{max}}} (a) &= P(X_1 \\leq a, X_2 \\leq a, \\ldots, X_n \\leq a) & \\mbox{Explanation 1} \\\\\n&= P\\big( (X_1 \\leq a) \\cap (X_2 \\leq a) \\cap \\ldots \\cap (X_n \\leq a) \\big) & \\mbox{Explanation 2}\\\\\n&= P(X_1 \\leq a) \\cdot P(X_2 \\leq a) \\cdot  \\ldots  \\cdot P(X_n \\leq a) & \\mbox{Explanation 3}\\\\\n&= F(a) \\cdot F(a) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot F(a) & \\mbox{Explanation 4}\\\\\n&= \\big( F(a) \\big)^n\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n\n### Solution to Question 5\n\n---\n\n**Explanation 1:**\n\n<br>  \n\n**Explanation 2:**\n\n<br>  \n\n**Explanation 3:**\n\n<br>  \n\n**Explanation 4:**\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n## Question 6\n\n---\n\nUsing the result from the previous problem, find\n$\\displaystyle f_{X_{\\rm{max}}} (a)$, the probability density function (pdf) for the maximum of a\nrandom sample.

The program has come under scrutiny in many cities regarding claims of racial-profiling. We investigate the following question:\n\n> Does the stop-and-frisk program in New York City seem to profile people based on race?\n\nIn 2022, 15,102 stops were recorded by NYPD, and these stops are broken down by race in the table below.\n\n| Race | 2022 NYPD Stops^[Data from [(NYPD Stop, Ask, and Frisk Data 2022](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page)] | NYC Population^[Data from [US Census Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/newyorkcitynewyork)] |\n|------|------------|------------------|\n| Black | 8,863 | $0.23$ |\n| Latinx | 4,477 | $0.29$ |\n| White | 1,077 | $0.32$ | \n| Asian/Pacific Islander | 320 | $0.14$ |\n| Mixed/Other | 365 | $0.02$ |\n| Total | 15102 | 1 |\n\n-   In the code cell below, we save the data in the table to two vectors `observe` and `prop`.\n-   Be sure to run the code cell below in order to answer the questions that follow.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobserve <- c(8863, 4477, 1077, 320, 365)  # vector of observed values\nprop <- c(0.23, 0.29, 0.32, 0.14, 0.02)  # vector of population proportions\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the jury example from our exploration with [sampling distributions for a single proportion](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd){target=\"_blank\"}, we considered whether people that identify their political party as Independent have fair representation. Political party was a binary variable (Independent or Not). Perhaps a more useful question to explore is whether the jury has a good representation of all political affiliations, not just Independents. When working with a categorical variable that has more than two categories, such as race or political affiliation, we need to consider more than a single proportion. Rather than consider a single proportion, we can conduct a  <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**chi-square goodness-of-fit test**</span> to measure how well the random sample resembles the population as far as what proportion of observations are in each category. We assume the categories are mutually exclusive (an observation cannot belong to multiple categories), and thus the sum of all proportions is 1.\n\n## Question 10\n\n---\n\nThis question guides us through the calculation of a statistic to measure how well racial demographics of the people stopped by NYPD in 2022 match the overall racial demographics of NYC in 2022.\n\n\n### Question 10a\n\n---\n\nFirst, we calculate the **expected** totals for each racial category.
