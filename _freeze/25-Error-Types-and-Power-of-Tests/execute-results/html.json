However, in this case we do not accept $H_0$. The test is inconclusive.\n\nAs with confidence intervals, it is possible we do all of our analysis perfectly without any mistakes, but our conclusion is incorrect due to the randomness in sampling. Rarely, we are unlucky and dealt a biased sample, in which case we arrive at an incorrect conclusion. \n\nIn this section, we explore the following questions:\n\n- What type of errors are possible with hypothesis testing?\n- What are the practical implications of making errors?\n- How can we calculate the probability of *correctly* rejecting $H_0$?\n\n\n# Type I and Type II Errors\n\n---\n\nThere are two possible errors in a hypothesis test:\n\n- A <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**type I error**</span> occurs if we incorrectly reject $H_0$ when it is true.\n  - This  is known as a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**false positive**</span>.\n  - For example, a jury falsely convicts an innocent person.\n- A <span style=\"color:tomato\">**type II error**</span> occurs if we incorrectly fail to reject $H_0$ when it is false.\n  - This  is known as a <span style=\"color:tomato\">**false negative**</span>.\n  - For example, a jury fails to convict a guilty person.\n\nFor example, when a jury is deciding a case in court, the hypotheses would be:\n\n- $H_0$: The accused person is innocent (we assume the person is innocent).\n- $H_a$: The accused person is guilty (requires evidence beyond a reasonable doubt).\n\nA jury can make two possible errors:\n\n- If they falsely convict an innocent person, they have made a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">type I error</span>. \n- If they do not convict a guilty person, they have made a <span style=\"color:tomato\">type II error</span>.\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n--- \n\nA hospital is testing to see whether a donated organ is a match for a recipient in need of an organ transplant. \n\n- $H_0$: The organ is not a match (boring). \n- $H_a$: The organ is a match (interesting). \n\nDescribe the type I and type II errors in this context. What are the practical consequences of making these errors?\n\n### Solution to Question 1\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n## Question 2\n\n---\n\nA lab runs viral tests to see whether a person is currently infected with COVID-19. \n\n- $H_0$: The person is not currently infected with COVID-19 (boring). \n- $H_a$: The person is currently infected with COVID-19 (interesting). \n\nDescribe the type I and type II errors in this context.

The cholesterol level 225 mg/dL is used to demarcate healthy from predisposed men. \n\n### Question 3a\n\n---\n\nGiven that a man is healthy, what is the probability they are diagnosed as predisposed? \n\n\n#### Solution to Question 3a\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code cell to help with calculations\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n### Question 3b\n\n---\n\nGiven that a man is not healthy, what is the probability they are not diagnosed as predisposed?\n\n#### Solution to Question 3b\n\n---\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code cell to help with calculations\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 3c\n\n---\n\nWhich of the previous answers gives the probability of a type I error and which is for a type II error?

State the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**hypotheses**</span> and identify (from the alternative claim in $H_a$) if it is a one or two-tailed test.\n  \n    - $H_0$ is the \"boring\" claim. Express using an equal sign $=$.\n    - $H_a$ is the claim we want to show is likely true. Use inequality sign ($>$, $<$, or $\\ne$).\n    - State both $H_0$ and $H_a$ in terms of population parameters such as $\\mu_1-\\mu_2$ and $p_1-p_2$.\n\n2. Compute the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**test statistic**</span>.\n\n    - If the observed sample contradicts the null claim, the result is significant.\n    - A standardized test statistic measures how many SE's the observed stat is from the null claim.\n    - A standardized test statistic with a large absolute value is supporting evidence to reject $H_0$.\n\n3. Using the null distribution, compute the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**p-value**</span>. The p-value is the probability of getting a sample with a test statistic as or more extreme than the observed sample assuming $H_0$ is true.\n\n    - The p-value is the area in one or both tails beyond the test statistic.\n    - The p-value is a probability, so we have $0 < \\mbox{p-value} < 1$.\n    - The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence to reject $H_0$.\n\n4. Based on the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**significance level**</span>, $\\alpha$, make a decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis\n\n    - If p-value $\\leq \\alpha$, we reject $H_0$.\n    - If p-value $> \\alpha$, we do not reject $H_0$.\n\n5.  <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Summarize the results**</span> in practical terms, **in the context of the example**.\n\n    - If we reject $H_0$, this means there is enough evidence to support the claim in $H_a$.\n    - If we do not reject $H_0$, this means there is not evidence to reject $H_0$ nor support $H_a$. The test is inconclusive.\n\n\n---\n\n![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png) <nbsp>\n\n*Statistical Methods: Exploring the Uncertain* by [Adam Spiegler](https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n",
