Our conclusions are going to be based on \nrandomness in the sampling process, and we will need to account for some \nuncertainty in our predictions. Statistics relies on theory and applications \nfrom probability to help quantify the uncertainty in our models and estimates. \n\n- <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**If we know the make up of a population, we can use probability to predict the likelihood that certain outcomes occur.**</span>\n  - If we know a six-sided is fair, what is the probability of rolling the die 10 times and getting exactly 4 rolls that land on 1?\n\n  \n- <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**We use statistics to go in the reverse direction. Namely, how can we make predictions about a population from a random sample of data.**</span>\n  - We want to determine whether or not a six-sided die is fair.

Is the die fair?\n  - We will need to use probability to answer statistical questions and make inferences about a population.\n\n# Sample Space, Outcomes and Events\n\n---\n\nA <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**statistical experiment or observation**</span> is any random activity that results in a definite outcome.\n\n-   The <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**sample space**</span>, $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\Omega}$, is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n-   An <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**outcome**</span>, $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\omega}$, is a result from an experiment or observation.\n-   An <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**event**</span>, $\\color{dodgerblue}{A}$, is a collection of one or more outcomes from an experiment or observation.\n\n\n## Example: Rolling a Fair Six-Sided Die\n\n---\n\n![Image Credit: Steaphan Greene, [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0), via Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/2-Dice-Icon.svg){fig-align=\"left\" width=20% fig-alt=\"Image of Two Die.\"} \n\nThe study of probability was initially inspired by calculating odds of outcomes from card and dice games. For example, consider a rolling a fair six-sided die.\n\n-   The sample space is $\\Omega = \\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\right\\}$\n-   For a fair die, each of the six possible outcomes has an equally likely chance of occurring.\n-   One possible outcome is rolling a 4, $\\omega = 4$\n-   Let $A$ denote the event that the roll is a multiple of 3, $A = \\left\\{ 3, 6 \\right\\}$.\n\n\n## Probabilities with Equally Likely Outcomes\n\n---\n\nFor finite sample spaces, we often use counting to determine probabilities. A special case which we will encounter often is when each outcome in the sample space $\\Omega$ is equally likely to occur, and therefore\n\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{\\mbox{Number of outcomes in event $A$}}{\\mbox{Total number of outcomes in $\\Omega$}} = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|}.$$\n\n\nWe use the notation $P(A)$ to denote the probability that event $A$ occurs.\n\n-   Probabilities are proportions between $0$ (impossible to occur) and $1$ (certain to occur) that we typically represent as decimals or fractions.\n-   The probability $P: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a function that maps each event in $\\Omega$ to a number in the interval $0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1$.\n-   Sometimes we convert the proportion to a percentage when giving a probability.\n  \n## Question 1\n\n---\n\nIf a person rolls a fair, six-sided die, what is the probability the result of the roll is a number that is divisible by 3?\n\n\n### Solution to Question 1\n\n---\n\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n### Installing and Loading `carData` Package\n\n---\n\nThe data set `Arrests` is in the `carData` package in R which is not installed in Google Colaboratory. \n\n- First run the code cell below to to install the `carData` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#install.packages(\"carData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n- Next load the package with the library command so we can access the `Arrests` data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(carData)\n```\n:::\n\n\n- **We can now access and explore the data set `Arrests` in `carData`.**\n\n## Question 2\n\n---\n\n\nUse R functions such as `summary()`, `str()`, and/or `?Arrests` to answer some questions about the data:\n\n- What data is included in the `Arrests` data set? \n- How many observations are in the data?\n- What is the population of interest?\n- What is the source of the data?\n- What are the categorical variables in the data set?\n- What are the quantitative variables in the data set?\n- Are the variable data types accurate, or do some variables need to be converted to other data types?\n\n### Solution to Question 2\n\n---\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use code cell to summarize and/or get help with Arrests data\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n## Question 3\n\n---\n\nSuppose you would like to analyze whether Black arrestees are more or less likely to be not released with a summons (and therefore detained in jail) compared to White arrestees. The two variables of interest are therefore `colour` and `released`.\n\n### Question 3a\n\n---\n\nUse the `table()` function, create a two-way table to summarize the relation between `colour` and `released`.\n\n#### Solution to Question 3a\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(??)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Question 3b\n\n---\n\nYou should see from your output in Question 3a that more White arrestees were released (559) compared the Black arrestees that were released (333). Why is it problematic to compare counts of White and Black arrestees and conclude White arrestees are more likely to be detained (not be released)?\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 3b\n\n---\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 3c\n\n---\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected arrestee in the study:\n\ni.  Was not released?\nii. Was Black?\niii. Was not released and was Black?\niv. Was not released or was Black?\nv.  Given that a person was Black, what is the probability they were not released?\n\n#### Solution to Question 3c\n\n---\n\nUse the code cell below to compute each of the probabilities (i)-(v).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Enter code to compute each of the following\n# Be sure to print results to screen!\n# Find the probability that a randomly selected person in the study:\n\n# (i) was not released\n\n\n# (ii) was Black\n\n\n# (iii) was not released and was Black\n\n\n# (iv) was not released or was Black?\n\n\n# (v) was not released given they were Black\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSummarize results below\n\ni.  The probability that a randomly selected person in the study was not released is ${\\color{dodgerblue}{P(N)=??}}$.\n\nii. The probability that a randomly selected person in the study was Black is ${\\color{dodgerblue}{P(B)=??}}.$\n\niii. The probability that a randomly selected person in the study was not released and was Black is ${\\color{dodgerblue}{P(N \\cap B)=??}}$.\n\niv. The probability that a randomly selected person in the study was not released or was Black is ${\\color{dodgerblue}{P(N \\cup B)=??}}$.\n\nv.  Given that a person was Black, what is the probability they were not released?\n\n $${\\color{dodgerblue}{P(N \\ | \\ B)=??}}$$\n\n\n### Question 3d\n\n---\n\nBased on the data from this study, do you believe Black arrestees are more, less, or equally likely to be detained (not be released) than White arrestees? Support your answer using probabilities. You may want to compute additional probabilities that were not asked in [Question 3c] before reaching your conclusion.\n\n#### Solution to Question 3d\n\n---\n\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n\n# Simple and Compound Probabilities\n\n---\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ denote two events in sample space $\\Omega$, then\n\n-   $\\color{dodgerblue}{P(A)}$ is the probability that event $A$ occurs.\n-   $\\color{dodgerblue}{P(A^C) = P(\\bar{A}) = P(A')}$ is the probability that event $A$ <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**does NOT occur**</span>.\n  -   The notation $\\color{dodgerblue}{A^C}$, $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\bar{A}}$, or $\\color{dodgerblue}{A'}$ are used to denote the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**complement**</span> of $A$.\n-   $\\color{dodgerblue}{P(A \\cap B)}$ is the probability that events $A$ <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**and**</span> $B$ both occur.\n-   $\\color{dodgerblue}{P(A \\cup B)}$ is the probability that either event $A$ <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**or**</span> event $B$ occurs (or both $A$ and $B$ occur).\n-   $\\color{dodgerblue}{P(B \\ | \\ A )}$ is the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**conditional probability**</span> that event $B$ occurs <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**given that**</span> event $A$ occurs.\n-   $\\color{dodgerblue}{P(A - B)}$ is the probability that <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**event A occurs and event B does not occur**</span>.\n\n\n# Properties of Probability\n\n---\n\nWe can generalize the calculations from the previous study on people arrested for small quantities of marijuana to obtain the following results:\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ denote two events in sample space $\\Omega$, then\n\n-   <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Additive property**</span>: $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$.\n-   <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Bayes' Theorem**</span>: $\\displaystyle P(B | A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}$\n-   <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Multiplicative property**</span>: $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B | A)$\n-   <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Complement property**</span>: $P(A^C) = 1 - P(A)$\n\n## Question 4\n\n---\n\nMatch one of the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Venn diagrams**</span> labelled (i)-(vi) in the table below to one of the set operations below.
