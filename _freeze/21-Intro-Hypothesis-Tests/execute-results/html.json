I claim that I do have telepathy. There are two possibilities: either I do or I do not. **Which claim is the null hypothesis and which is the alternative?**\n\n### Solution to Question 1\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n## Question 2 {#sec-q2}\n\n---\n\nThere are many different studies we could design to test these competing claims. I will collect data as as follows:\n\n- I will think of a letter A, B, C, or D.\n- I will telepathically communicate this letter to everyone.\n- Each person will tell me what letter they believed I was thinking of.\n\nIf I could collect responses from everyone in the population, I could calculate the parameter $p$, the proportion of all responses from everyone in the world that are the correct letter.\n\n- If $H_0$ is true, what would you expect the value of $p$ to be? \n- If $H_a$ is true, what would you expect the value of $p$ to be?\n\n### Solution to Question 2\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n## Question 3 {#sec-q3}\n\n---\n\nI cannot conduct my study on everyone in the world. Instead, I pick a sample of people from which to collect data. Suppose I am in a room with 15 other people who will participate in the study as designed in [Question 2]. Let $\\hat{p}$ denote the proportion of the people in the room that correctly say the letter I was thinking of.   \n\n> What would be enough evidence to convince you that I do have telepathy? \n\nState your answer in terms of the value of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$.\n\n### Solution to Question 3\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# Performing a Hypothesis Test\n\n---\n\nThe general process for performing a hypothesis test is informally:\n\n1. State the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of population parameter(s).\n2. Collect data from a sample and calculate test statistic(s).\n3. Assess which claim is more likely to be true.\n4. What conclusions (if any) can we make about the two competing claims?\n\nWe will dive deeper into each step, but for now we take a tour through the process in the context of two different studies. Before considering our first example, we focus on setting up the hypotheses in Step 1.\n\n\n## Stating the Hypotheses\n\n---\n\nDeciding on a clear and pertinent set of hypotheses is perhaps the most important step in hypothesis testing. Carefully setting up hypotheses helps keep our analysis on track so we achieve our goal. \n\n\n### The Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n\n---\n\n\n- The <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**null hypothesis**</span> is a \"boring\" claim. If the null hypothesis is true, this would not really affect or change what is currently believed. \n- The <span style=\"color:tomato\">**alternative hypothesis**</span> is the new or exciting claim a researcher is hoping to establish that is in direct competition with the boring claim in the null hypothesis. \n\nFor example, we generally believe coins are \"fair\" in the sense that when you flip a coin it has a 50% chance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails.  It would be more interesting if somebody claimed that a coin was not fair. \n\n#### Two-Tailed Tests\n\n---\n\nLet $p$ denote the proportion **of all flips** of a coin that land on heads. If our goal is to show a coin is not fair, without indicating a direction of the bias, we could set up hypotheses \n\n- $H_0$: $p=0.5$. The coin is fair (boring).\n- $H_a$: ${\\color{tomato}{p \\ne 0.5}}$. The coin is not fair (what we want to prove).\n\nIf we claim a coin is not fair **without specifying a direction of the bias**, we use a ${\\color{tomato}{\\ne}}$ sign in $H_a$, and we say the test is a <span style=\"color:tomato\">**two-tailed test**</span>. There are other ways we could claim a coin is biased.\n\n#### One-Tailed Tests\n\n---\n\nA coin might be more biased to land on heads ($p > 0.5$). A coin might be more biased to land on tails ($p < 0.5$). \n\n- If we want to test the claim that a coin is **biased to land on heads**: \n  - $H_0$: $p=0.5$. The coin is fair (boring).\n  - $H_a$: ${\\color{tomato}{p > 0.5}}$. The coin is biased to heads (what we want to prove).\n- If we want to test the claim that a coin is **biased to land on tails**: \n  - $H_0$: $p=0.5$. The coin is fair (boring).\n  - $H_a$: ${\\color{tomato}{p < 0.5}}$. The coin is biased to tails (what we want to prove).\n\nWhen we specify a direction of the inequality we use either <span style=\"color:tomato\">$>$ or $<$</span> in $H_a$, and we say the test is a <span style=\"color:tomato\">**one-tailed test**</span>.\n\n### Guidelines for Stating Hypotheses\n\n---\n\nFrom the examples above, we note some helpful guidelines for setting up hypotheses: \n\n- We state hypotheses **both in words and using mathematical notation**.\n  - Clearly stating the hypothesis in words will help us interpret results.\n  - Using appropriate mathematical notation will help guide our statistical analysis.\n- The hypotheses must be **competing claims**.\n- Be sure to clearly indicate the **population of interest**.\n- When using notation to state the hypotheses:\n  - Use **population parameters** such as $\\mu$ and $p$.\n  - Do not state hypotheses using statistics such as $\\bar{x}$ or $\\hat{p}$.\n  - We always use an <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">equality sign, $=$, in $H_0$</span>.\n  - We always use an <span style=\"color:tomato\">inequality sign ($\\ne$, $>$, or $<$) in $H_a$.</span>\n\n## Computing a Test Statistic\n\n---\n\nStating our hypotheses in mathematical notation is extremely helpful in helping us decide which sample statistics will be most helpful in assessing our hypotheses. Essentially, based on the population parameters we use in $H_0$ and $H_a$, we use the corresponding statistic(s) from the sample(s). For example:\n\n- If we want to test claims about $p$, calculating $\\hat{p}$ will be useful.\n- If we want to test claims about $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$, calculating $\\bar{x}_1-\\bar{x}_2$ will be useful.\n\nOften we standardize statistics, for example using $z$-scores. We will explore this idea more deeply later.\n\n## Assess Which Claim is More Likely {#sec-informal-p}\n\n---\n\nWhen we set up hypotheses, we use a boring claim for the null hypothesis the that is generally assumed to be true. The alternative hypothesis is a new claim, if true, would cause us to doubt and possibly reject the null claim.\n\n- Our goal is not to prove anything about the null claim $H_0$.\n- **Our goal is to show $H_a$ is very likely true by showing $H_0$ is very unlikely to be true.**\n\nThe logic in hypothesis testing is similar to a proof technique called proof by contradiction.\n\n- **We assume the boring claim $H_0$ is true**.\n- We hope to prove our assumption is unlikely, and thus the opposite ($H_a)$ is true.\n\nBased on our test statistic(s) and whether the alternative hypothesis is two-tailed or one-tailed, we assess statistical significance as follows:\n\n- If the <span style=\"color:tomato\">test statistic is likely if $H_0$ is true</span>, then we do not have evidence to reject $H_0$.\n  - The test is <span style=\"color:tomato\">**not statistically significant**</span>.\n  - The test is inconclusive. \n  - We neither reject nor accept $H_0$.\n- If the <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">test statistic is unlikely if $H_0$ is true in the direction of the claim in $H_a$</span>, then we have evidence that refutes $H_0$ and supports $H_a$.\n  - The test is <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">**statistically significant**</span>.\n  - We reject $H_0$ and accept $H_a$.\n\nWhat do we mean be \"likely\" and \"unlikely\"? We consider the concept informally at first, and we will [explore this concept more deeply later](#sec-p-formal) using <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**p-values**</span>. \n\n\n## Making a Conclusion\n\n---\n\nIn the end, there are two possible results from a hypothesis test. Either:\n\n- The test **is statistically significant**.\n  - We reject $H_0$.\n  - We accept the competing claim, $H_a$.\n- The test **is not statistically significant**. \n  - We fail to reject $H_0$. We do NOT accept $H_0$.\n  - The test is inconclusive as far as $H_a$ is considered,\n\nWe will more formally discuss just how unlikely or likely a sample must be in order to for the result to be statistically significant. Informally, we assume the null hypothesis is true and require **evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that $\\mathbf{H_0}$ is not true** in order to be convinced we should reject $H_0$. \n\nWe do not want different researchers subjectively choosing what \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" means to them. We hope to control for confounding variables in our studies, and making this decision as objective as possible helps account for potential bias by the researchers. In statistical hypothesis testing, a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**significance level**</span> is used to make this decision.\n\n## Question 4: Unscrupulous Diner's Dilemma {#sec-diner}\n\n---\n\n\n![Credit: Benreis, [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0), via Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Pay_the_bill.JPG){fig-align=\"left\" width=45% fig-alt=\"Paying the Bill\"}\n\n\nAn article^[Gneezy, U., E.

When a group of diners jointly enjoys a meal at a restaurant, often an unspoken agreement exists to divide the check equally. A selfish diner could thereby enjoy exceptional dinners at bargain prices. This dilemma typifies a class of serious social problems^[Glance, N., and B. Huberman, [\"The Dynamics of Social Dilemmas\"](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/1994/glance1994a.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}, *Scientific American*] from environmental protection and resource conservation to eliciting charity donations and slowing arms races.\n\n\nResearchers wanted to test whether people order more food and beverages when they know the bill is going to split evenly, or do they order the same amount regardless of whether they are splitting the bill or paying individually.\n\n### Question 4a\n\n---\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses both in words and using mathematical notation.\n\n#### Solution to Question 4a\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 4b\n\n---\n\nTo test the claims, participants were randomly assigned into two tables, each with four people. One table (even-split group) was randomly picked and told they were going to evenly-split the bill. The other table (control) was told each person was going to pay for what they ordered.

We distinguish between two aspects of this type of utility,\n\nOne group received a mailing emphasizing the <span style=\"color:mediumseagreen\">intrinsic (internal) satisfaction</span> for voting:\n\n\n![Intrinsic Mailing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory/main/Images/21fig-intrinsic.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\nAnother group received a mailing placing <span style=\"color:tomato\">extrinsic (outside) pressure</span> on people to vote:\n\n![Extrinsic Mailing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory/main/Images/21fig-extrinsic.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\n### Question 5a\n\n---\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses the researches can use to test whether positive or negative pressure is more effective at improving voter turnout.

Rather, explain how you could use sample data to compute a test statistic.*\n\n#### Solution to Question 5b\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n# Measuring Significance: p-Values {#sec-p-formal}\n\n---\n\nEarlier we informally discussed the [concept of significance](#sec-informal-p). Recall the logic of hypothesis tests, we assume $H_0$ is true and consider whether the sample data supports or refutes the null claim. $p$-values are more formal statistics used to measure significance in hypothesis testing.\n\nThe $\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mathbf{p}}$<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**-value**</span> is the **probability that we would get a random sample** with a test statistic as or more extreme as the observed test statistic **if the null hypothesis were true**.\n\n$${\\large {\\color{dodgerblue}{p\\mbox{-value} = P( \\mbox{test statistic as or more extreme than observed} \\ | \\ H_0 \\mbox{ is true} )}}}.$$\n\n-   The **smaller the $p$-value**, the **less likely the sample** is assuming $H_0$ is true.\n  - There is evidence that **contradicts $H_0$ and supports $H_a$**.\n  - The **smaller the $p$-value**, the **more statistically significant** the result.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nA $p$-value is a probability, so we have $0 < p\\mbox{-value} < 1$. The closer the $p$-value is to $0$, the more significant the result.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n$p$-values measure the probability of our observed sample (assuming $H_0$ is true). $p$-values do not measure the probability that either $H_0$ or $H_a$ is correct or not.\n:::\n\n\n## Question 6\n\n---\n\nRecall the telepathy example in [Questions 1](#sec-q1), [2](#sec-q2), and [3](#sec-q3). Let $T$ be the number of people (out of the possible 15 people in the room) that said the correct the letter I was thinking. **Suppose we observed that 12 out of 15 people correctly said the letter I was thinking.**\n\n### Question 6a\n\n---\n\nCalculate the $p$-value of the observed test statistic. Use the R code cell below to help with the calculation.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIn 15 identical and independent trials under the assumption $H_0$ is true, what is $P(T \\geq 12)$?\n:::\n\n#### Solution to Question 6a\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# p-value of the observed 12 out 15 successes\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 6b\n\n---\n\nBased on the value of the $p$-value, what can we conclude about my telepathy ability?\n\n#### Solution to Question 6b\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n# The Null Distribution\n\n---\n\nThe <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**null distribution**</span> is the distribution of the test statistic **if the null hypothesis is true**. We use the null distribution to calculate the p-value.\n\n## Question 7\n\n---\n\nWhat is the null distribution for the previous telepathy example?\n\n### Solution to Question 7\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n---\n\n![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png) <nbsp>\n\n*Statistical Methods: Exploring the Uncertain* by [Adam Spiegler](https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n",
