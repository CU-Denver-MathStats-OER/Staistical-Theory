From a bootstrap distribution, we can define a new estimator:\n\n- We defined the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">estimator $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\rm{boot}}$</span> as the mean (expected) value of the bootstrap distribution.\n- We use the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">bootstrap standard error</span> to estimate the variability or uncertainty in estimates due to the randomness of sampling.\n- We defined the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">bootstrap estimate of bias</span> as $\\mbox{Bias}_{\\rm{boot}} \\big( \\hat{\\theta}_{\\rm{boot}} \\big) = \\hat{\\theta}_{\\rm{boot}} - \\left( \\mbox{observed sample statististic} \\right)$.\n  - For example, in the case of estimating a population mean $\\mu$, we have ${\\color{dodgerblue}{\\mbox{Bias}_{\\rm{boot}} \\big( \\hat{\\mu}_{\\rm{boot}} \\big) = \\hat{\\mu}_{\\rm{boot}} - \\bar{x}}}$.\n\nIn this section we will discuss how we can use the bootstrap standard error to account for the uncertainty in our estimate and to incorporate that uncertainty in our final estimate.\n\n\n# Case Study: Ozone Concentration in New York City\n\n---\n\n![Credit: [Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM)](https://www-f.nescaum.org/documents/listos)](https://www-f.nescaum.org/documents/listos/AQI_Map_170518.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=65% fig-alt=\"Map of Air Quality in Northeastern US\"}\n\nAccoording to the Unites States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)^[<https://www.epa.gov/ozone-pollution-and-your-patients-health/what-ozone> accessed June 26, 2023]:\n\n> Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms. It is both a natural and a man-made product that occurs in the Earth's upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) and lower atmosphere (the troposphere).  Depending on where it is in the atmosphere, ozone affects life on Earth in either good or bad ways.\n\n\nWhen the ozone concentration is greater, respiratory illnesses such as asthma, pneumonia, and bronchitis can become exacerbated. While the effects of short-term exposure to high ozone concentration are reversible, long-term exposure may not be reversible. The EPA sets Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)^[[Ozone Air Quality Standards acccessed from EPA June 26, 2023](https://www.epa.gov/naaqs/ozone-o3-air-quality-standards)]. \"The existing primary and secondary standards, established in 2015, are 0.070 parts per million (ppm)\", or equivalently 70 parts per billion (pbb).\n\nWe will begin todays work with bootstrap distributions investigating the following question:\n\n> **Is the population of New York City experiencing  long-term exposure to unhealthy levels of ozone?**\n\n\n## Loading NYC Ozone Data\n\n---\n\nIt is very likely you do not have the package `lattice` installed. You will need to first install the `lattice` package.\n\n- Go to the R Console window.\n- Run the command `> install.packages(\"lattice\")`. \n\nYou will only need to run the `install.package()` command one time. You can now access `lattice` anytime you like! However, you will need to run the command `library(lattice)` during any R session in which you want to access data from the `lattice` package.  **Be sure you have first installed the `lattice` package before executing the code cell below.**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# be sure you have already installed the lattice package\nlibrary(lattice)  # loading permute package\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Summarizing and Storing the Data\n\n---\n\nIn the code cell below we summarize a data frame^[Bruntz, Cleveland, Kleiner, and Warner.

How can we calculate the sample mean birth weights for the non-smoking group separate from the smoking group? One way to compare the two samples is to split the sample into two independent subsets based on whether or not the child was birthed by a smoker or not.\n\n## Question 8\n\n---\n\nAnswer the questions to find an initial estimate for the difference in the mean birth weights of all children born to a non-smoking parent compared to the mean birth weight of all children born to a parent that did smoke while pregnant.\n\n\n### Question 8a\n\n---\n\n\nComplete each of the `subset()` commands below to subset the data into two independent samples: parent was a smoker and parent was a non-smoker.\n\n#### Solution to Question 8a\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# subset the sample into two independent samples\nnon <- subset(??, smoke == ??)\nsmoker <- subset(??, smoke == ??)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n### Question 8b\n\n---\n\nComplete the code cell below to calculate, store, and print the difference in sample means based on the data in our original sample. \n\n\n#### Solution to Question 8b\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# calculate difference in sample means\nobs.diff <- ??\nobs.diff  # print observed difference to screen\n```\n:::\n\n  \n  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n### Question 8c\n\n---\n\nBased on your answer to [Quesiton 8b], given an estimate for the difference in the mean birth weights of all children born to a non-smoking parent compared to the mean birth weight of all children born to a parent that did smoke while pregnant. *Include units in your answer.*\n\n#### Solution to Question 8c\n\n---\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n### Question 8d\n\n---\n\nBased on your estimate in [Question 8c], do you believe there is a difference in the mean birth weight of all babies whose parent smoked while pregnant compared to the mean birth weight of all babies whose parent did not smoke while pregnant?\n\n#### Solution to Question 8d\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n## Accounting for Uncertainty in Sampling\n\n---\n\nIn the case of comparing samples, we do need to be mindful of the randomness involved in the sampling process. If we pick another sample of 189 babies and compare the difference in sample means, we will likely get another value for the difference in sample means. How can we determine whether the difference in sample means is larger than the variability we might expect due to sampling?\n\n# Bootstrapping Two Independent Samples\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nGiven independent samples of sizes $m$ and $n$ from two independent populations:\n\n1.

Lock, K. Lock, E. Lock, and D.\n    Lock.\n\nA study[^2] tested whether wearing wetsuits influences swimming velocity.\nTwelve competitive swimmers swam 1500 meters at maximum speed twice each.\n\n[^2]: de Lucas, Balidan, Neiva, Grecco, and Denadai.\n    \"The effects of wetsuits on physiological and biomechanical indices during swimming'', *Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport*.\n\n-   Once wearing a wetsuit and once wearing a regular bathing suit.\n-   The order of the trials was randomized.\n-   Each time, the maximum velocity in meters/sec of the swimmer was recorded.\n-   The max velocity with and without the wetsuit are recorded in the table below.\n\n| Swimmer          | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      | 7      | 8      | 9      | 10     | 11     | 12     |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| New Wetsuit      | $1.57$ | $1.47$ | $1.42$ | $1.35$ | $1.22$ | $1.75$ | $1.64$ | $1.57$ | $1.56$ | $1.53$ | $1.49$ | $1.51$ |\n| Regular Swimsuit | $1.49$ | $1.37$ | $1.35$ | $1.27$ | $1.12$ | $1.64$ | $1.59$ | $1.52$ | $1.50$ | $1.45$ | $1.44$ | $1.41$ |\n| Difference       | $0.08$ | $0.10$ | $0.07$ | $0.08$ | $0.10$ | $0.11$ | $0.05$ | $0.05$ | $0.06$ | $0.08$ | $0.05$ | $0.10$ |\n\n### Question 4a\n\n---\n\nThe code cell below contains ordered vectors of maximum velocities (with the wetsuit and with a regular swimsuit) for each of the 12 swimmers.\nThe ordering in each vector must be consistent since we have natural pairing of values between the two samples.\nCompute the observed mean matched-pair difference.\n\n#### Solution to Question 4a\n\n---\n\nComplete the code cell below by replacing each `??` with appropriate code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Vectors containing the times of each swimmer.
