Thus far, we have analyzed statistical questions where bootstrapping different statistics has been constructive, such as a [single sample mean](16-Bootstrap-Dist.qmd#sec-jawboot) and a [sample proportion](17-Bootstrap-Confidence-Int.qmd#sec-bootprop). In many situations, we wish to investigate the possible association between two or more variables. In these cases,  comparing two or more sample statistics is more useful than a single mean or a single proportion.\n\nFor example, we investigated whether there is an association between the [smoking during pregnancy and birth weight of the baby](17-Bootstrap-Confidence-Int.qmd#sec-smoking).\n\n- A sample of $n=189$ new born babies are selected.\n- The smoking status of the pregnant parent and the birth weight (in grams) are recorded.\n  - Out of the sample $n_{\\rm{no}} = 115$ non-smokers, the average birth weight is $\\bar{x}_{\\rm{no}} = 3055.7$ grams.\n  - Out of the sample $n_{s} = 74$ non-smokers, the average birth weight is $\\bar{x}_{s} = 2771.9$ grams.\n- Is the observed difference in sample means significant?\n  \nWe used a bootstrap distribution on a [difference of two independent sample means](17-Bootstrap-Confidence-Int.qmd#sec-bootdiffmean) to construct a bootstrap confidence interval to estimate the difference in mean birth weights to help determine whether a difference of $0$ is plausible or not.\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n---\n\nThe data used in the smoking and birth weight analysis is from an observational study. We determined the observed [difference in sample means is significant](17-Bootstrap-Confidence-Int.qmd#sec-interpret), and thus concluded smoking during pregnancy is likely associated with lower baby birth weights. However, with observational studies we should be mindful of confounding variables. Based on our analysis we can conclude smoking is associated with a change in birth weight, but not whether the smoking itself is the cause of the change in birth weight. What are some possible [confounding variables](01-Intro-to-Inference.qmd#sec-confounding)?\n\n\n### Solution to Question 1\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n## Designing a Randomized Controlled Experiment\n\n---\n\nIn order to see whether smoking during pregnancy causes lower birth weights, we could try to design a randomized controlled experiment. Designing such an experiment that is humane in this context might not be possible. For example, here is an example of a highly unethical experiment we would not implement in practice:\n\n- Collect volunteers early in their pregnancy who agree to the conditions of the experiment.\n- Randomly assign each pregnant person to a smoking or non-smoking group.\n  - Each person in the smoking group is required to smoke 1 pack of cigarettes per day.\n  - Each person in the non-smoking group is forbidden from smoking any tobacco during pregnancy.\n- Record the birth weight of each person's baby.\n- Compare mean birth weights of the two groups (smokers and non-smokers).\n\nAlthough such an experiment does eliminate the impact of many confounding variables, it is not possible to conduct this experiment due to ethical concerns.\n\n\n## Collecting Pairs of Data\n\n---\n\nLet's consider one more study that we could use to help determine whether smoking during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weight. In this study, we solicit volunteers that have already given birth to two babies. During one of the pregnancies, the parent smoked. During the other pregnancy, they did not smoke. This study is ethical and controls for some confounding variables though not all. Below is hypothetical data from such a study. A sample of $n=10$ people volunteer to share their data with the researchers from which we have 10 different pairs of birth weights (in grams) summarized in the table\nbelow.\n\n\n|             | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   |\n|-------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| No Smoking  | 2750 | 2920 | 3860 | 3402 | 2282 | 3790 | 3586 | 3487 | 2920 | 2835 |\n| Smoked      | 1790 | 2381 | 3940 | 3317 | 2125 | 2665 | 3572 | 3156 | 2721 | 2225 |\n\n\n\n## Question 2\n\n---\n\nUsing the data from this study, give a possible sample statistic that can be used to determine if smoking is associated with lower birth weight. \n\n\n### Solution to Question 2\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# data from study\nno <- c(2750, 2920, 3860, 3402, 2282, \n        3790, 3586, 3487, 2920, 2835)  # non-smoking births weights\n\nsmoker <- c(1790, 2381, 3940, 3317, 2125, \n            2665, 3572, 3156, 2721, 2225)  # matching smoking birth weight\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n## Question 3\n\n---\n\nDevise a bootstrapping method that could be used to construct a bootstrap distribution for the comparison statistic you identified in [Question 2]. \n\n\n### Solution to Question 3\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n\n# Matched Pairs Design\n\n--- \n\nLet's recap and compare data sets from two different studies investigating potential side-effects of smoking during pregnancy:\n\n\n<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Study A:**</span>  There is a sample of 189 observations corresponding to 189 different pregnancies. For each observation, we have two values corresponding to smoking status and birth weight of baby. The sample is split based on whether or not the parent smoked during their pregnancy. For any single observation in the non-smoking group, there is no inherent connection to any of the observations in the smoking group. The non-smoker and smoker groups are <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**independent samples**</span>.\n\n<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Study B:**</span>  There is a sample of $n=10$ observations corresponding to $10$ different people who each gave birth to two children. During one of the pregnancies they smoked, and they did not smoke during the other.  For each observation, we have two variables: birth weight of baby when they smoked and the birth weight of the baby during the non-smoking pregnancy. For any single observation in the non-smoker group of birth weights, there is exactly one observation (their sibling) in the smoker group of birth weights that naturally form a pair of observations. This is an example of a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**matched pairs design**</span> since observations from each sample are matched based on a key variable. In this case, we pair non-smoking and smoking birth weights based on parent of the baby.\n\n\n# Boostrapping with Matched Pairs\n \n---\n\n\n**When we bootstrap matched pairs, we do not want randomness to affect the natural pairing between the two samples!**  Below is an algorithm for bootstrapping matched pairs. In order to preserve the pairing of the smoking and non-smoking birth weights, we do a single resample from the original sample of differences as opposed to two resamples from two independent samples.  \n\nGiven a <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**matched pairs sample**</span> of size $n$:\n\n1. For each pair calculate the difference.\n\n|             | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   |\n|-------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| No Smoking  | 2750 | 2920 | 3860 | 3402 | 2282 | 3790 | 3586 | 3487 | 2920 | 2835 |\n| Smoked      | 1790 | 2381 | 3940 | 3317 | 2125 | 2665 | 3572 | 3156 | 2721 | 2225 |\n| <span style=\"color:tomato\">Difference</span>  | <span style=\"color:tomato\">960</span> | <span style=\"color:tomato\">539</span>   | <span style=\"color:tomato\">-80</span>  | <span style=\"color:tomato\">85</span>   | <span style=\"color:tomato\">157</span>  | <span style=\"color:tomato\">1125</span> | <span style=\"color:tomato\">14</span>   | <span style=\"color:tomato\">331</span>  | <span style=\"color:tomato\">199</span>  | <span style=\"color:tomato\">610</span>  |\n\n\n2. Consider the collection of $n$ differences as your original sample. We now focus on this single vector of differences. \n\n    -  Our original sample of differences is ${\\color{tomato}{\\mathbf{x} = (960, 539, -80, \\ldots , 199, 610)}}$.\n    -  We store the sample of differences in the vector `diff` in the code cell below.\n    -  The sample mean difference between matched pairs for the original data is stored in `obs.mean`.\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nno <- c(2750, 2920, 3860, 3402, 2282, \n        3790, 3586, 3487, 2920, 2835)  # non-smoking birth weights\nsmoker <- c(1790, 2381, 3940, 3317, 2125, \n            2665, 3572, 3156, 2721, 2225)  # matching smoking birth weight\n\n\ndiff <- no - smoker  # storing the original sample of differences\nobs.mean <- mean(diff)  # observed mean difference between matched pairs\n\n# print observed mean to screen\nobs.mean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 394\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n3.

Explain why or why not.\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 4c\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>\n<br>  \n\n\n# Bootstrapping Other Statistics\n\n---\n\nWhen constructing sampling distributions for with means and proportions, in addition to bootstrapping, we also have a theoretical model available with the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). For example, we when working with golden jackal data, we constructed a [bootstrap distribution](16-Bootstrap-Dist.qmd#sec-jawboot) to approximate the sampling distribution for the sample mean mandible length. Then we compared the bootstrap results to those obtained using the [CLT for means](16-Bootstrap-Dist.qmd#sec-jawclt). However, not all statistics have a Central Limit Theorem or formulas we can use to model a sampling distribution.\n\n\n-   The bootstrap procedure may be used with a wide variety of other statistics, such as medians, variances, trimmed means, and ratios.\n-   **We can construct a bootstrap distribution to estimate the sampling distribution for any statistic, even if there is no Central Limit Theorem.**\n\n\n## Question 5\n\n---\n\nA random sample of $n=20$ mandible jaw lengths (in mm) of golden jackals is stored in the vector `jaw.sample`. Run the code cell below to load the sample data, and then answer the questions that follow.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njaw.sample <- c(120, 107, 110, 116, 114, 111, 113, 117, 114, 112,\n                110, 111, 107, 108, 110, 105, 107, 106, 111, 111)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Question 5a\n\n---\n\nBelow is [code we previously used](16-Bootstrap-Dist.qmd#sec-jawboot) to create bootstrap distribution for the **sample mean** mandible length. Adjust the code to create a bootstrap distribution for the **sample median** mandible length. Then run the updated code cell to store the bootstrap medians in the vector named `boot.dist`. *No output will printed to the screen since the output is being stored in `boot.dist`.*\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 5a\n\n---\n\nAdjust the code cell below to create a bootstrap distribution for the sample median.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN <- 10^5  # Number of bootstrap samples\nboot.dist <- numeric(N)  # create vector to store bootstrap stats\n\n# for loop that creates bootstrap dist\nfor (i in 1:N)\n{\n  x <- sample(jaw.sample, 20, replace = TRUE)  # pick a bootstrap resample\n  boot.dist[i] <- mean(x)  # compute mean of bootstrap resample\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n### Question 5b\n\n---\n\nUsing the bootstrap distribution `boot.dist` created in [Question 5a], give a 90% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the median mandible length of all golden jackals. *Include units in your answer.*\n\n\n#### Solution to Question 5b\n\n---\n\nReplace all four `??` in the code cell below with appropriate code. Then run the completed code to compute lower and upper cutoffs for a 90% bootstrap percentile confidence interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# find cutoffs for 90% bootstrap CI\nlower.median.90 <- quantile(??, probs = ??)  # find lower cutoff\nupper.median.90 <- quantile(??, probs = ??)  # find upper cutoff\n\n# print to screen\nlower.median.90\nupper.median.90\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**Based on the output above, a 90% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the median is from ?? to ??.**\n\n<br>  \n<br>\n\n\n\n# Bootstrapping Ratios\n\n---\n\nWhen investigating the possible effect of smoking during pregnancy on birth weight, we initially used the `birthwt` data frame  in the `MASS` package to construct a bootstrap distribution for the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**difference of means (DoM)**</span>. From the bootstrap distribution, we obtained a confidence interval to estimate the difference in the mean birth weights between children of those that smoked and those that did not smoke during pregnancy. One possible 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the difference of means is $80 \\mbox{ g} < \\mu_{\\rm{non}} - \\mu_{s} < 486 \\mbox{g }$.\n\n- Since $0$ is not inside the interval estimate, it is not plausible that $\\mu_{\\rm{non}} - \\mu_{s} =0$ g.\n- We can conclude that there is a difference in the mean birth weights of babies of smokers and non-smokers.\n\nAnother comparative analysis we can do is compare the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**ratio of means (RoM)**</span> instead of the difference of means. Let $R = \\dfrac{\\mu_{\\rm{non}}}{\\mu_{\\rm{s}}}$ denote the ratio of population means. $R$ is an unknown population parameter that we can analyze as follows:\n\n- If $R = \\dfrac{\\mu_{\\rm{non}}}{\\mu_{\\rm{s}}} > 1$, then $\\mu_{\\rm{non}} > \\mu_{\\rm{s}}$.\n- If $R = \\dfrac{\\mu_{\\rm{non}}}{\\mu_{\\rm{s}}} < 1$, then $\\mu_{\\rm{non}} < \\mu_{\\rm{s}}$.\n- If $R = \\dfrac{\\mu_{\\rm{non}}}{\\mu_{\\rm{s}}} = 1$, then $\\mu_{\\rm{non}} = \\mu_{\\rm{s}}$.\n\nWhether we use a difference or ratio of means can highlight or minimize certain characteristics of the data. With ratios, we generally get sample ratios close 1. With differences, we can get a large spread of values in the differences of sample means. Thus, one potentially nice outcome of using ratios is the magnitude of the sample statistics will be smaller and easier to compare with other ratios from other contexts that will also have values close to 1. Another nice advantage is the results are independent of the units we choose to measure birth weight. If we choose to measure birth weights in pounds instead of grams, birth weights will be closer to 7, 8, 9 pounds as opposed to values such as 2000 or 3000 grams. We get different confidence intervals for the difference in mean birth weights depending on whether we use grams or pounds. The bootstrap confidence intervals we get for a ratio of means will be the same regardless of the units for weight.\n\n\n\n\n# Case Study: Smoking and Birth Weights {#sec-smoking}\n\n---\n\n\nRecall the data set `birthwt` from the `MASS` package we [worked with earlier](17-Bootstrap-Confidence-Int.qmd#sec-smoking).

The answer to this question does not depend on the bootstrap estimate of bias alone. We need to consider how much bias is present relative to the overall variability in sample statistics. For example:\n\n- If the bootstrap estimate of bias is $5$ and $\\mbox{SE}_{\\rm{boot}} = 5,\\!000$, then relatively speaking the bias is quite small.\n- If the bootstrap estimate of bias is $-0.1$ and $\\mbox{SE}_{\\rm{boot}} = 2$, then relatively speaking the bias is much larger.\n- We compare the value of the bootstrap estimate of bias **relative to the bootstrap standard error**.\n  - In the first example, we have the ratio $\\frac{5}{5000} = 0.001$.\n  - In the second example, we have a ratio $\\frac{-0.1}{2} = -0.05$\n- In general, we use the ratio of the bootstrap bias to the bootstrap standard error to measure how significant is the bias.\n\n$${\\color{dodgerblue}{\\boxed{ \\mbox{Relative Bootstrap Bias} = \\dfrac{\\mbox{Bootstrap Bias}}{\\mbox{Bootstrap SE}}}}}$$\n\n#### <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**Rule of Thumb for Bootstrap Bias**</span>\n\n--- \n\n<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">If either </span>\n\n$${\\color{dodgerblue}{\\frac{\\mbox{Bootstrap Bias}}{\\mbox{Bootstrap SE}}  > 0.02 \\qquad \\mbox{or} \\qquad \\frac{\\mbox{Bootstrap Bias}}{\\mbox{Bootstrap SE}}  < -0.02,}}$$\n\n<span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">then the bias is large enough to have a substantial effect on the accuracy of the estimate.</span> \n\n## Question 12\n\n---\n\nDetermine whether the jackal mandible bootstrap distribution in [Question 8], the ozone concentration bootstrap distribution for sample proportion in [Question 9], or the bootstrap distribution for the difference in mean birth weights [Question 10] exceed the 0.02 rule of thumb. Relatively speaking, which of the three biases is most extreme?\n\n\n\n### Solution to Question 12\n\n---\n\n<br>  \n<br>  \n<br>  \n\n\n---\n\n![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png) <nbsp>\n\n*Statistical Methods: Exploring the Uncertain* by [Adam Spiegler](https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n\n\n",
