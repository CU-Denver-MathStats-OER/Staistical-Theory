# What is R and What is RStudio?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a programming language used largely for statistical computing, data wrangling and visualization.

-   R is **FREE** to download.
-   The first stable version was released in 2000.
-   Open source and works cross all platforms.
-   Excellent tool for data wrangling.
-   Generates nice graphics.
-   Export to pdf, html, Word or PowerPoint.
-   Large community with tons of useful packages.

**RStudio** is an IDE (integrated development environment) for R.
More simply stated, RStudio is an application that allows you to edit, run, and see results of code.

-   RStudio is available in open source editions and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
-   **RStudio Desktop** is **FREE** to download locally on your device.
-   **RStudio Server** runs on a remote server through a web browser.

# Installing R and RStudio is FREE!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 0: Visit <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

## Step 1: Install R

-   **Mac Users:** Download R by visiting <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/> and clicking on the most recent version. For example depending on the version number, the file name is `R-4.2.2-arm64.pkg` or `R-4.2.2.pkg` depending on what type of Mac you own.
    -   **Note there are two versions available for Mac OS**.

    -   Use the top link for `R-4.2.2-arm64.pkg` for M1 and higher Macs only.

    -   Use the second link for `R-4.2.2.pkg` for Intel Macs.

    -   If you are not sure which version of Mac you have, [here is a good source](https://www.howtogeek.com/706226/how-to-check-if-your-mac-is-using-an-intel-or-apple-silicon-processor/).
-   **PC Users:** Download R by visiting <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> and clicking on the most recent version. For example depending on the version number, the file name is `R-4.2.2 for Windows`.

## Step 2: Install RStudio

-   Visit <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
-   Select the **DOWNLOAD R STUDIO DESKTOP** button for the **FREE** open source edition.
-   Do NOT choose a version that costs money.

# Opening R Studio

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have both R and RStudio on your computer, you can begin using R by opening the RStudio program.
Open RStudio just as you would any program, by clicking on its icon or other methods such as typing "RStudio" at the Windows Run prompt.

## Downloading and Opening this File

1.  Clink on the link <https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory>. Link can be found in description of this video.
2.  Right/Secondary click on the link to the file `Installing-R-and-RStudio.Rmd` and choose `Save Link As ...`.
3.  Choose the file location on your computer where you wish to save this file.
4.  From RStudio, choose `File -> Open File` and select the appropriate file location.

# Key Packages to Get Started

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **What are packages in R?**

> "Many useful R function come in packages, free libraries of code written by R's active user community." Source: [R Studio support website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201057987-Quick-list-of-useful-R-packages)

-   For a nice overview see <https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201057987-Quick-list-of-useful-R-packages>.
-   You can install a single package such as `dplyr` by running R the code cell below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

-   Or you can install several at once, in the Console below (or running the code cell below).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "DataExplorer"))
```

-   **You only need to install a package once (or when updating).**
-   **The packages above have not yet been loaded however!**

# Loading Libraries of Functions in Packages

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Although we only need to intall a package once in order to access it, **we need to load package each time we start a new R session**.
-   You can load the libraries in a package by running the code cell below.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

# What is R Markdown?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an R Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:
