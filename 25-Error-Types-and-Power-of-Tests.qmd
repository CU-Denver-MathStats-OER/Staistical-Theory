Type I (on left) and Type II (on right) Errors 
:::



The  result of a hypothesis test has one of two possibilities:

- If <span style="color:mediumseagreen">**p-value $\leq \alpha$,  we reject $H_0$**</span>, and we have enough evidence to support the claim in $H_a$.
- If <span style="color:tomato">**p-value $> \alpha$, we fail to reject $H_0$**</span>. However, in this case we do not accept $H_0$. The test is inconclusive.

As with confidence intervals, it is possible we do all of our analysis perfectly without any mistakes, but our conclusion is incorrect due to the randomness in sampling. Rarely, we are unlucky and dealt a biased sample, in which case we arrive at an incorrect conclusion. 

In this section, we explore the following questions:

- What type of errors are possible with hypothesis testing?
- What are the practical implications of making errors?
- How can we calculate the probability of *correctly* rejecting $H_0$?


# Type I and Type II Errors

---

There are two possible errors in a hypothesis test:

- A <span style="color:dodgerblue">**type I error**</span> occurs if we incorrectly reject $H_0$ when it is true.
  - This  is known as a <span style="color:dodgerblue">**false positive**</span>.
  - For example, a jury falsely convicts an innocent person.
- A <span style="color:tomato">**type II error**</span> occurs if we incorrectly fail to reject $H_0$ when it is false.
  - This  is known as a <span style="color:tomato">**false negative**</span>.
  - For example, a jury fails to convict a guilty person.

For example, when a jury is deciding a case in court, the hypotheses would be:

- $H_0$: The accused person is innocent (we assume the person is innocent).
- $H_a$: The accused person is guilty (requires evidence beyond a reasonable doubt).

A jury can make two possible errors:

- A <span style="color:dodgerblue">type I error</span> occurs when a jury falsely convicts an innocent person.
- A <span style="color:tomato">type II error</span> occurs when a jury fails to convict a guilty person.

## Question 1

--- 

A hospital is testing to see whether a donated organ is a match for a recipient in need of an organ transplant. 

- $H_0$: The organ is not a match (boring). 
- $H_a$: The organ is a match (interesting). 

Describe the type I and type II errors in this context. What are the practical consequences of making these errors?

## Question 2

- $H_0$: The person is not currently infected with COVID-19 (boring). 
- $H_a$: The person is currently infected with COVID-19 (interesting). 

Describe the type I and type II errors in this context. What are the practical consequences of making these errors?

## Question 3

The cholesterol level of healthy men is normally distributed with a mean of 180 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 20 mg/dL, whereas men predisposed to heart disease have a mean cholesterol level of 300 mg/dL with a standard deviation of 30 mg/dL. The cholesterol level 225 mg/dL is used to demarcate healthy from predisposed men. 

### Question 3a

A company claims that only 3% of people who use their facial lotion develop an allergic reaction (a rash). You are suspicious of their claim based on hearing some of your friends had an allergic reaction, and you believe it is more than 3%. You pick a random sample of 50 people and have them try the lotion. **If more than 3 out of the 50 people develop the rash, you will blow up social media with posts about the dishonesty of the company's claim.**



### Question 5a

# Rejection Regions

---

When performing a hypothesis test at a significance level of $\alpha$, the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**rejection or critical region**</span>, denoted <span style="color:dodgerblue">$\mathcal{R}$</span>, is the set of all values of the test statistic for which we reject $H_0$. The endpoint(s) of the region are called <span style="color:dodgerblue">**critical values**</span>.

## Question 6

---

In [Question 4] we tested whether or not a ten-sided die is fair by rolling it 20 times and counting the number of rolls that land on an even number. If $p$ is the proportion of all rolls that land on an even number, then we have

$$H_0: p = 0.5 \qquad \mbox{vs.} \qquad H_a: p \ne 0.5.$$

### Question 6a

---

If you found only $X=7$ rolls landed on an even number, what is the p-value?

## Question 7

---

Suppose you are interested in the lengths of a certain species of snake in an ecosystem. Assume the lengths (in cm.) are normally distributed with unknown mean $\mu$, but the standard deviation of the population is known to be $\sigma = 4$ cm. It has been claimed that the mean length of this species is 25 cm. You believe the actual mean length is greater than 25 cm. You collect a random sample of 30 snakes. You will test using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$.


### Question 7a

<br>  
<br>  


## Definition of the Power of a Test

---

The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**power**</span> of a test is the **probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$**.

$${\color{dodgerblue}{\mbox{power} = P(\mbox{Reject } H_0 \  | \  H_a \mbox{ is true}) = 1 - {\color{tomato}{\beta}}}},$$

where <span style="color:tomato">$\beta$</span> denotes the <span style="color:tomato">probability of a type II error</span>.


# Additional Practice

---

## Question 8

---

Let $X_1$, $X_2$, $\ldots$ , $X_{12}$ be a random variable from a [Bernoulli distribution](07-Common-Discrete-RandVar.qmd#sec-append-binom) with unknown probability $p$. We test 

$$H_0: p=0.3 \qquad \mbox{versus} \qquad H_a: p < 0.3.$$ 

We will reject the null if the number of success $Y= X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_{12} \leq 1$.

### Question 8a

---

Find the probability of a type I error.

#### Solution to Question 8a

---


```{r}
# code cell to help with calculations

```

<br>  
<br>  
 


### Question 8b

---

If the alternative hypothesis is true, find an expression for the power, $1-\beta$, as a function of $p$.


#### Solution to Question 8b

---


```{r}
# code cell to help with calculations

```

<br>  
<br>  


## Question 9

---

You draw a random sample $X_1, X_2, \ldots , X_{10}$ from an [exponential distribution](08-Common-Continuous-Distributions.qmd#sec-append-exp) $f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ (recall $\mu = 1/\lambda$). You will test 

$$H_0: \lambda = 0.25 \qquad \mbox{versus} \qquad H_a: \lambda < 0.25.$$ 

You decide you will reject the null hypothesis if at least 3 of the values of $X_i$ are greater than 9.

# Appendix: Summary of Hypothesis Testing

---

1. State the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**hypotheses**</span> and identify (from the alternative claim in $H_a$) if it is a one or two-tailed test.
  
    - $H_0$ is the "boring" claim. Express using an equal sign $=$.
    - $H_a$ is the claim we want to show is likely true. Use inequality sign ($>$, $<$, or $\ne$).
    - State both $H_0$ and $H_a$ in terms of population parameters such as $\mu_1-\mu_2$ and $p_1-p_2$.

2. Compute the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**test statistic**</span>.

    - If the observed sample contradicts the null claim, the result is significant.
    - A standardized test statistic measures how many SE's the observed stat is from the null claim.
    - A standardized test statistic with a large absolute value is supporting evidence to reject $H_0$.

3. Using the null distribution, compute the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**p-value**</span>. The p-value is the probability of getting a sample with a test statistic as or more extreme than the observed sample assuming $H_0$ is true.

    - The p-value is the area in one or both tails beyond the test statistic.
    - The p-value is a probability, so we have $0 < \mbox{p-value} < 1$.
    - The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence to reject $H_0$.

4. Based on the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**significance level**</span>, $\alpha$, make a decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis

    - If p-value $\leq \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.
    - If p-value $> \alpha$, we do not reject $H_0$.

5.  <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Summarize the results**</span> in practical terms, **in the context of the example**.

    - If we reject $H_0$, this means there is enough evidence to support the claim in $H_a$.
    - If we do not reject $H_0$, this means there is not evidence to reject $H_0$ nor support $H_a$. The test is inconclusive.
