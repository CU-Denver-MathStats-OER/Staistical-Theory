%In the September 9, 1990 issue of \textit{Parade} magazine, the columnist Marilyn vos Savant responded to this letter:

%\begin{quotation}
%\textit{Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say number 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat. He says to you, ``Do you want to pick door number 2?'' Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?}
%\end{quotation}
%\hfill --Craig. F. Whitaker in Columbia, MD \bs

%The letter roughly describes a situation faced by contestants on the 1970’s game show Let’s Make a Deal, hosted by Monty Hall and Carol Merrill.


%\bb
%\ii After the host opens door 3, what is the best strategy: change doors or trust your initial choice? Play online and see how your strategy works:   \href{http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/MontyHall/Monty04.html}{\underline{http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/MontyHall/Monty04.html}}\label{playgame} \vfill

%\ii Rather than using simulations as in \ref{playgame}, give theoretical argument for why one strategy might be better than the other.\label{theorygame} \vfill

\ii In the 1970s, research\footnote{\href{www.laskerfoundation.org/rprimers/sommer/saving1.htm}{www.laskerfoundation.org/rprimers/sommer/saving1.htm} and \textit{Introduction to the Practice of Statistics}, 4th en, by David Moore, George. McCabe}  by Alfred Sommer on vitamin A and night blindness suggested that vitamin A also reduced childhood death rates. Children were randomly assigned to two groups, one group took a vitamin A pill every day, and children in the other group were given a \alert{placebo} (a pill that had no vitamin A). Below is a \colorb{two-way table} displaying the results of Sommer’s research.

\ii \textbf{\alert{Additive rule}}: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$.
\ii \textbf{\alert{Bayes' Theorem}}: $\dsty P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$
\ii \textbf{\alert{Multiplicative rule}}: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B | A)$

Answer the following questions if we know that 
\[ P(S) = 0.6, \quad P(H) = 0.45,\mbox{ and} \quad P(H | S ) = 0.65 \] \label{q:cars}

\pagebegin{Independent Events}

\bi
\ii Is a newly developed vaccine effective?
\ii Do certain sentencing laws have an effect on crime rates?
\ii Did increasing the minimum wage for fast food workers effect fast food prices?
\ii \textbf{Does the occurrence of one event (getting a sunroof) effect the likelihood that another event (heated seats) occurs?}
\ei

\bb[resume]
\ii In the car option example in question \ref{q:cars}, we know that  $P(S) = 0.6$, $P(H) = 0.45$, and $P(H | S ) = 0.65$. Based on this information, \textbf{if a customer has purchased the sunroof option, are they more, less, or equally likely to get the heated seats option?} Explain how you determined your answer.
