# 2.5: Common Continuous Distributions

---

As we did with [discrete random variables](07-Common-Discrete-RandVar.qmd), in this section we will take a look at several of the most common and useful distributions when working with continuous random variables.

# Normal Distributions

There are many situations where data tends to be distributed symmetrically around a central value with no bias to the left or right such as the location of beads on a [Galton board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_board) or heights of people. For example, if we randomly select an adult from the population:

-   A person is mostly to be about average height.
-   Otherwise, the person selected is equally likely to be either shorter or taller than average.
-   The person is very unlikely to have an extreme height (tall or short). The more extreme, the less likely.
-   **Therefore the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric and bell shaped.**

<span style="color:dodgerblue">**Normal distributions**</span> arise in many settings: heights of people, size of items produced by machines, and most importantly in statistics data sets resulting from many independent random events. The shape of a normal distribution is determined by two parameters:
   
-   The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**mean**</span>, $\color{dodgerblue}{\mu}$, is the center of the distribution.
-   The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**standard deviation**</span> $\color{dodgerblue}{\sigma}$, tells us how wide the distribution is.
-   If $X$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, we write $\color{dodgerblue}{\mathbf{X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)}}$.
-   The resulting distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
x <- seq(-10, 10, length=1000)
stan <- dnorm(x)

std <- c(1, 2, 4)
colors <- c("black", "blue", "red")
labels <- c("sigma=1", "sigma=2", "sigma=4")

plot(x, stan, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="Comparison of St Dev")

for (i in 1:3){
  lines(x, dnorm(x, 0, std[i]), lwd=2, col=colors[i])
}

legend("topright", inset=.05, title="Distributions",
  labels, lwd=2, lty=1, col=colors)
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
x <- seq(-7, 7, length=100)
stan <- dnorm(x)
mu <- c(0, 3)
colors <- c("black", "blue")
labels <- c("mu=0", "mu=3")

plot(x, stan, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="Comparison of Means")

}

```

## Question 1

---

What effect does increasing the standard deviation have on the shape of a normal distribution? What effect does increasing the mean have on the shape of a normal distribution?

### Solution to Question 1

---

<br>  
<br>  
<br>  


# The 68%-95%-99.7% Empirical Rule {#sec-empirical}

---

The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**empirical rule**</span> for normal distributions states approximately:

-   68% of all values fall within one standard deviation (both above and below) from the mean.
-   95% of all values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
-   99.7% of all values fall within three standard deviations of the mean.

::: {.callout-caution}
This rule does not apply to all distributions. The less normal the data, the less accurate the rule becomes.
:::

## Question 2

---

Cholesterol is a fat-like substance present in all cells in your body. Humans require some cholesterol to properly function and remain healthy. If a person’s blood has too much cholesterol, then they are at a higher risk of developing heart disease. A blood test is used to measure
cholesterol levels.  Below is an excerpt from a study^[Prasad Tharu B, Tsokos CP. *A Statistical Study of Serum Cholesterol Level by Gender and Race*. J Res Health Sci. 2017 Jul 25. ] on the distribution of cholesterol levels.

> Cholesterol is a growing issue because of its impact on human health. Cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol are the most clearly established risk factors that have been identified as being strongly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). Total serum cholesterol level (SCL) is a major risk factor for CHD which is the leading cause of death in the United States. CHD is responsible for more deaths than all forms of cancer combined. 

The distribution of cholesterol levels for adults age 20 or older is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 200
mg/dL and standard deviation 40 mg/dL. Let $X$ be the cholesterol level of a randomly selected adult age 20 or above. Thus, we have $X \sim N(200, 40)$.


### Question 2a

---

What proportion of adults age 20 or above have total cholesterol levels between 200 mg/dL and 240 mg/dL?

#### Solution to Question 2a

---

<br>  
<br>  
<br>  

### Question 2b

---

What proportion of adults age 20 or above have total cholesterol levels between 160 mg/dL and 280 mg/dL?

#### Solution to Question 2b

---

<br>  
<br>  
<br>  


### Question 2c

---

Individuals that have a total cholesterol level more than 240 mg/dL should be regarded as high risk for heart disease. What proportion of the adult population age 20 or above is at high risk for heart disease?


#### Solution to Question 2c

---

<br>  
<br>  
<br>  

### Question 2d

---

How many standard deviations from the mean is a total cholesterol level of 140 mg/dL?

#### Solution to Question 2d

---

<br>  
<br>  
<br>  


# $z$-Scores and the Standard Normal Distribution

---

The number of standard deviations a data value $x$ is from the mean $\mu$ is called the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**z-score**</span> for the value $x$.

- We compute the signed distance of $x$ from the mean, $\mu$.
- Then we describe the distance in terms of standard deviations (as opposed to in units of $x$).
- The formula for the $z$-score of $x$ is therefore

$$\color{dodgerblue}{\large z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}}.$$

For example, the $z$-score of an adult with a total cholesterol level of 140 mg/dL is $z=\frac{140-200}{40} = -1.5$. This means a total cholesterol level of 140 mg/dL is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean level.


![Image Credit: Adam Spiegler, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), via Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/08fig-standardize.png){fig-alt="Standardizing a normal distribution"} 

- Comparing areas in the figure above, we see that $P(X<140) = P(Z < -1.5) $.
- <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Thus, using either the original distribution or the distribution of $z$-scores gives the same result.**</span>


When we compute the $z$-score, we are <span style="color:dodgerblue">**"standardizing"**</span> the normally distributed data. We describe values of random variable $X$ in terms of how many standard deviations each value $x$ is from the mean $\mu$. The resulting distribution of $z$-scores is called the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**standard normal distribution**</span> that has mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$. 

## Question 3

---

Body Mass Index (BMI) is often used as a measurement to determine whether a person's weight is considered healthy. BMI is computed by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by their height (in meters) squared . BMI is easy and inexpensive to measure, thus it is frequently used to screen for whether a person is malnourished, healthy, or overweight. For example, some countries have passed laws preventing companies from hiring models that are considered underweight based on BMI.

> Israel became the first country ever to pass legislation banning the use of "underweight" models in local ads and publications. The new law employs an interesting tactic: Models must prove that their Body Mass Index (BMI) is higher than the World Health Organization's indication of malnourishment (a BMI of 18.5) by producing an up-to-date medical report --- no older than three months --- at all shoots to be used in the Israeli market^["Israel Passes Law Requiring Models to Show Health Records and Meet Weight Standards", *New York Magazine* by Charlotte Cowles on April 20, 2012].

Like heights and cholesterol levels, BMI distribution is approximately normal. In Israel, adult women have a mean BMI of $26.5$ with a standard deviation $4.5$.

### Question 3a

---

Calculate the $z$-score of an adult Israeli woman with a BMI of $18.5$.


#### Solution to Question 3a

---

<br>  
<br>  
<br>  


### Question 3b

---

Interpret the meaning of the value in [Question 3a], and give an estimate for the proportion of adult women in Israel who are legally underweight.

#### Solution to Question 3b

---

<br>  
<br>  
<br>  



# The Probability Density Function for Normal Distributions

---

The probability density function for a normal distribution $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ is called a <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Gaussian function**</span> whose formula is

$$\color{dodgerblue}{\large f(x; \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right)^2}}.$$

::: {.callout-note}
The formula for a Gaussian depends on both irrational numbers $\pi$ and $e$.  How surprising and cool is that!
:::


# Calculating Areas Under Normal Distributions

---

To find the probability that an adult woman in Israel has a BMI less than $18.5$, we need to calculate the area to the left of $x=18.5$ under the normal curve with formula $f(x; 26.5, 4.5)$. We can try to evaluate

$$P(X < 18.5) = \int_{0}^{18.5} \frac{1}{4.5\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-26.5}{4.5} \right)^2} \, dx$$

::: {.callout-important}
YIKES, good luck with that! We cannot find a formula for the antiderivative of $f(x; 26.5, 4.5)$, so we need to find other methods for calculating this area.
:::



## Using a Standard Normal Distribution Table

---

A standard normal distribution table can be used to determine the areas under the standard normal distribution, $N(0,1)$. There are different variations of standard normal distributions. The table in the figure below gives the area under the standard normal distribution to the left of a given $z$-score. For example, if we want to determine what proportion of adult women in Israel have a BMI less than $18.5$:

1. Find the corresponding $z$-score of the BMI measurement $x=18.5$. In [Question 3a], we determined $z \approx -1.78$.
2. Look down the first column of the table and identify the row corresponding to the $z$-score to one decimal place of accuracy, $z=-1.7$
3. Identify the column corresponding to the second decimal place of the $z$-score, $0.08$.
4. The area to the left of $z=-1.78$ is the value located at the intersection of the row in step 2 and column in step 3.

From the figure below, we have $P(X < 18.5) = P(Z < -1.78) \approx 0.0375$.

## Using R to Compute Areas

---

Standard normal distribution tables were very useful prior to spread statistical software and technology. If we are working in R, we do not need to use tables to get approximations. Instead, we can use R functions to compute these areas more accurately. 

Similar to binomial, geometric, and Poisson distributions, R has built in functions to perform calculations with normal distributions. In particular, the function `pnorm()` calculates values of the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution:

-   `pnorm(x, mean, sd)`$=P(X<x)$ gives the area to the left of $x$ under $N(\mu,\sigma)$.
-   `pnorm(x, mean,  sd, lower.tail=FALSE)`$=P(X>x)$ gives the area to the right of $x$ under $N(\mu,\sigma)$.

Or you can find the $z$-score and use the standard normal distribution in R as well:

-   `pnorm(z, 0, 1)`$=P(Z<z)$ gives the area to the left of $x$ under $N(0,1)$.
-   `pnorm(z, 0,  1, lower.tail=FALSE)`$=P(Z>z)$ gives the area to the right of $x$ under $N(0,1)$.

::: {.callout-warning}
Do not use the function `dnorm(x, mean, sd)` to compute probabilities related to normal distribution since `dnorm()` returns the height of the probability density function. For continuous random variables, $P(X < x)$ is the area to the left of $x$, not the height of the function. Be sure to use `pnorm(x, mean, sd)` to compute $P(X < x)$.

# Continuous Uniform Distribution

---

If a continuous random variable is <span style="color:dodgerblue">**uniformly distributed**</span> on the interval $\lbrack a , b \rbrack$, then the pdf is 

$$f(x; a, b) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{1}{b-a}, & a \leq x \leq b\\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right. .$$

## Question 6

## Question 7

<br>  
<br>  


# Exponential Distributions

---

Distributions come in all shapes in and sizes. For example:

-   Uniform distributions model situations in which each outcome has an equally likely chance to occur.
-   Normal distributions model distributions that are bell shaped.

<span style="color:dodgerblue">**Exponential distributions**</span> are often useful when considering the length of time between successive occurrences of an event.

  -   Most of the time, you do not need to wait very long for the next light rail. 
  -   As the wait time $x$ increases, it gets less and less likely that the next train has not already arrived.
  -   The distribution is shaped like the graph of an exponential function.

## Normal Distributions {#sec-append-normal}

---

If $X$ is <span style="color:dodgerblue">**normally distributed**</span> with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, we write $\color{dodgerblue}{X \sim N( \mu ,\sigma)}$. The formula for the probability density is called the Gaussian and is given below.


$$f(x; \mu, \sigma) = \dfrac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right)^2}$$

- The expected value is $E(X) = \mu$.
- The variance is $\mbox{Var} (X) = \sigma^2$.
- Use `dnorm(x, mu, sigma)` to calculate $f(x)$.
  - <span style="color:tomato">Recall for continuous distributions, $f(x)$ gives the height of the pdf.</span>
  - <span style="color:tomato">Probabilities are areas under $f(x)$ (not the heights).</span>
  - <span style="color:tomato">**DO NOT use `dnorm()` to compute probabilities.**</span>
- <span style="color:mediumseagreen">**Use `pnorm(x, mu, sigma)` to calculate $P(X \leq x)$, the area to the left of $X=x$.**</span>
   -   <span style="color:mediumseagreen">**One last warning, be sure to use `pnorm()` to compute probabilities not `dnorm()`.**</span>
- Use `rnorm(n, mu, sigma)` to generate a random sample of size $n$ from population $X \sim N(mu, sigma)$.
- Use `qnorm(q, mu, sigma)` to find the q^th^ percentile.
- We have the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**68%-95%-99.5% Empirical Rule**</span>.
- We can standardize the normal distribution using <span style="color:dodgerblue">**z-scores**</span>:
$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  # plot in a 1 by 2 array

x <- seq(15, 65, length=1000)

plot(x, dnorm(x, 40, 5), type="l", col = "red", xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="pdf for N(40,5)")

plot(x, pnorm(x, 40, 5), type="l", col = "blue", xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="cdf for N(40,5)")
```

## Continuous Uniform Distributions {#sec-append-unif}

---

$X$ is a <span style="color:dodgerblue">**continuous uniform distribution**</span> when $X$ is equally likely to equal to any value on the closed, continuous interval $\lbrack a , b \rbrack$. If a continuous random variable is uniformly distributed on the interval $\lbrack a , b \rbrack$, the pdf is

$$f(x; a,b) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \dfrac{1}{b-a} & a \leq x \leq b\\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right. .$$

The corresponding cdf is

$$F(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
0, &  x<a \\ 
\frac{x-a}{b-a}, &  a \leq x \leq b \\ 
1,  &  x>b 
\end{array} \right. .$$

-   The expected value is $E(X) = \dfrac{a+b}{2}$ 
-   The variance is $\mbox{Var}(X) = \dfrac{(b-a)^2}{12}$

When working with uniform distributions, it is typically easier to calculate probabilities "by hand" without the need for technology. However, R does have functions to help!

- Use `dunif(x, a, b)` to find the height of the pdf function, which is $\frac{1}{b-a}$.
  - There is really no need to use the function since the pdf has a constant height.
  - <span style="color:tomato">**DO NOT use `dunif()` to compute probabilities.**</span>
- Use `punif(x, a, b)` to calculate $P(X \leq x)=\int_a^x \frac{1}{b-a} \, dt = \frac{x-a}{b-a}$.
  - **Probabilities can be found by computing areas of rectangles which may be easier!**
- Use `runif(n, a, b)` to generate a random sample of size $n$ from population $X \sim \mbox{Unif}(a, b)$.
- Use `qunif(q, a, b)` to find the q^th^ percentile.


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  # plot in a 1 by 2 array
x <- seq(3, 5, length=1000)
y <- seq(2.5, 5.5, length=1000)

plot(x, dunif(x, 3, 5), type="l", col = "red", xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="pdf Uniform on [3,5]",
  xlim = c(2.5, 5.5), ylim = c(0, 0.75))

g = function(y) {
  (y < 3) * (0) + (y >= 3 & y <= 5) * (punif(y, 3, 5)) + (y > 5) * (1)
}

plot(y, g(y), type="l", col = "blue", xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="cdf Uniform on [3,5]",
  xlim = c(2.5, 5.5))
```

## Exponential Distributions {#sec-append-exp}

---

Let $X$ be the amount of time between the successive events if we know the average time between occurrences is $\mu$. The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**rate parameter** $\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu}$</span> is the average number of times the event occurs per unit of time. Then $X$ is <span style="color:dodgerblue">**exponentially distributed**</span> with rate parameter $\lambda$, and we write $\color{dodgerblue}{X \sim \mbox{Exp} (\lambda)}$.

The pdf for $X \sim \mbox{Exp} (\lambda)$ is the exponential function 

$$f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \quad \mbox{for } x >0 .$$

-   The expected value is $E(X) = \dfrac{1}{\lambda}=\mu$ 
-   The variance is $\mbox{Var}(X) = \dfrac{1}{\lambda^2} = \mu^2$.
- Use `dexp(x, lambda)` to find the height of the pdf function, which is $\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$.
  - <span style="color:tomato">**DO NOT use `dexp()` to compute probabilities.**</span>
- Use `pexp(x, lambda)` to calculate $P(X \leq x)=\int_0^x \lambda e^{-\lambda t} \, dt$.
  - It never hurts to practice your integration and check with `pexp()`!
- Use `rexp(n, lambda)` to generate a random sample of size $n$ from population $X \sim \mbox{Exp}(\lambda)$.
- Use `qexp(q, lambda)` to find the q^th^ percentile.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  # plot in a 1 by 2 array

x <- seq(0, 20, length=1000)

plot(x, dexp(x, 1/5), type="l", col = "red", xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="pdf of Exp(1/5)",
  xlim = c(-0.5, 20))

plot(x, pexp(x, 1/5), type="l", col = "blue", xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="cdf of Exp(1/5)",
  xlim = c(-0.5, 20))
```

## Gamma Distributions {#sec-append-gamma}

---

A <span style="color:dodgerblue">**gamma distribution**</span> is a distribution that arises naturally in processes for which the waiting times between events are relevant. Suppose we know that $\mu$ is the mean amount of time between successive occurrences of an event. Let $X$ be the amount of time it takes for the event to occur $r$ times.

- The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**rate parameter**</span> $\color{dodgerblue}{\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu}}$ tells us how many times an event occurs per unit of time. 
- The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**shape parameter**</span> $\color{dodgerblue}{r}$ denotes the total number of occurrences we will wait to occur.

Then $X$ will follow a gamma distribution that we denote $\color{dodgerblue}{X \sim \mbox{Gamma} ( r, \lambda)}$. The pdf is given by

$$f(x;r, \lambda) = \frac{1}{(r-1)!} \lambda^r x^{r-1} e^{-\lambda x} \quad \mbox{for } x >0 .$$


- The expected value is $E(X) = \dfrac{r}{\lambda}$
- The variance is $\mbox{Var}(X) = \dfrac{r}{\lambda^2}$.
- Use `dgamma(x, r, lambda)` to find the height of the pdf function which is generally not too useful.
  - <span style="color:tomato">**DO NOT use `dgamma()` to compute probabilities.**</span>
- Use `pgamma(x, r, lambda)` to calculate $P(X \leq x)$.
- Use `rgamma(n, r, lambda)` to generate a random sample of size $n$ from population $X \sim \mbox{Gamma}(r, \lambda)$.
- Use `qgamma(q, r, lambda)` to find the q^th^ percentile.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  # plot in a 1 by 2 array

x <- seq(0, 25, length=1000)

plot(x, dgamma(x, 3, 1/2), type="l", col = "red", xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="pdf of Gamma(3, 1/2)",
  xlim = c(-0.5, 25))

plot(x, pgamma(x, 3, 1/2), type="l", col = "blue", xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="cdf of Gamma(3, 1/2)",
  xlim = c(-0.5, 25))
```
