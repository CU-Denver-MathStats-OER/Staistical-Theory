# Public Opinion Polls

---

Confidence intervals are frequently used when polling public opinion. Rather than give a point estimate alone, poll results are typically given along with a  <span style="color:dodgerblue">**margin of error**</span> corresponding to a specified <span style="color:dodgerblue">**confidence level**</span>, which is typically 95%. For example, summarized in the bar plot and table below are the results of a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll^["Politics still drives how Americans fell about COVID response, one year in", [PBS/News Hour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/politics-still-drives-how-americans-feel-about-covid-response-one-year-in), March 11, 2021] that surveyed ${\color{tomato}{n=1,\!227}}$ randomly selected adults in the US and gauged their opinions on how the US is handling the COVID pandemic approximately one year after the initial outbreak in the United States.

# A General Summary of Confidence Intervals

--- 

A confidence interval is an interval estimate for a population parameter with a rate of success given by the confidence level of the interval. We can construct confidence intervals for all sorts of statistics, and we can use confidence intervals as a tool for analyzing possible associations between two different variables. In general, a confidence interval has three components:

- A point estimate is calculated from a sample.
- A confidence level is chosen.
- A margin of error (MoE) to account for the uncertainty due to sampling. 
  - The MoE depends on the confidence level that is chosen.
  - Careful, the MoE is different from the standard error, but they are related!
  - **The MoE is a multiple of the standard error, SE.**


If we want to construct a confidence interval estimate for parameter $\theta$, then we have

$$({\color{dodgerblue}{\mbox{point estimate}}}) - {\color{tomato}{\mbox{MoE}}} < \theta < ({\color{dodgerblue}{\mbox{point estimate}}}) + {\color{tomato}{\mbox{MoE}}}.$$ 

All confidence intervals have this same general structure that we can construct using similar steps:


1. <span style="color:dodgerblue">Choose a point estimate.</span>
2. Using the CLT, estimate the standard error.
3. Based on the confidence level, find the appropriate multiple ($z_{\alpha/2}$ or $t_{\alpha/2}$).
4. <span style="color:tomato">The margin of error (MoE) is the of product the SE and either $z_{\alpha/2}$ or $t_{\alpha/2}$.</span>


#### Confidence Intervals for a Single Mean with Known $\sigma^2$

---

If we would like to estimate a population mean $\mu$ of a population that has known variance $\sigma^2$, we can pick a random sample of $n$ values from the population. As long as the [sample is large enough](#sec-samp-size) or symmetric, we have:

1. <span style="color:dodgerblue">A reasonable point estimate is the corresponding sample mean, $\bar{x}$.</span>
2. From CLT, the standard error is $\mbox{SE} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
3. Using the standard normal distribution, find the value of $z_{\alpha/2}$.
4. <span style="color:tomato">The MoE $= z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.</span>


$$ {\color{dodgerblue}{\overline{X}}} - {\color{tomato}{z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}} < \mu < {\color{dodgerblue}{\overline{X}}} + {\color{tomato}{z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}} .$$ 


#### Confidence Intervals for a Single Mean with Unknown $\sigma^2$

---

If we would like to estimate a population mean $\mu$ of a population that has unknown variance $\sigma^2$, we can pick a random sample of $n$ values from the population. As long as the [sample is large enough](#sec-samp-size) or symmetric, we have:

1. <span style="color:dodgerblue">A reasonable point estimate is the corresponding sample mean, $\bar{x}$.</span>
2. We use CLT, <span style="color:mediumseagreen">plugging $s$ in place of $\sigma$</span>, to get  $\mbox{SE} = \frac{{\color{mediumseagreen}{s}}}{\sqrt{n}}$.
3. Using a <span style="color:mediumseagreen">$t$-distribution</span>, find the value of ${\color{mediumseagreen}{t_{\alpha/2}}}$.
4. <span style="color:tomato">The MoE $= {\color{mediumseagreen}{t_{\alpha/2}}} \cdot \frac{{\color{mediumseagreen}{s}}}{\sqrt{n}}$.</span>


$${\color{dodgerblue}{\overline{X}}} - {\color{tomato}{t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}} < \mu < {\color{dodgerblue}{\overline{X}}} + {\color{tomato}{t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}} .$$ 

#### Confidence Interval for a Difference in Two Means

---

If we would like to estimate the difference in means from two independent populations that have unknown variances, we can pick random samples of sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ from each respective population. As long as the [samples are large enough](#sec-samp-size) or symmetric, we have:

1. <span style="color:dodgerblue">A reasonable point estimate is the corresponding difference in sample means, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$.</span>
2. We use CLT, <span style="color:mediumseagreen">plugging $s_1$ and $s_2$ in place of $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$</span>, to get  

$${\color{mediumseagreen}{\mbox{SE} = \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}}.$$

3. Using a <span style="color:mediumseagreen">$t$-distribution</span>, find the value of ${\color{mediumseagreen}{t_{\alpha/2}}}$.
4. <span style="color:tomato">The MoE $= {\color{mediumseagreen}{t_{\alpha/2}}} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{{\color{mediumseagreen}{s_1}}^2}{n_1} + \frac{{\color{mediumseagreen}{s_2}}^2}{n_2}}$.</span>


$$\left( {\color{dodgerblue}{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}} \right) - {\color{tomato}{t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}} < \mu_1 - \mu_2 < \left( {\color{dodgerblue}{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}} \right) + {\color{tomato}{t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}} .$$ 

## Question 2

---

We would like to estimate the parameter $p$, the proportion of all adults in the US that do not plan on getting vaccinated. From the vaccination poll in [Question 1], we have one random sample of 1,227 adults. From our sample, we observe that 30% said they do not intend to get vaccinated. Let's apply the same general process summarized above to construct a 95% confidence interval to estimate the **proportion** of all adults in the US that do not plan on getting vaccinated.


### Question 2a

---

Based on the sample of polled adults, what is a reasonable point estimate for $p$, the proportion of all adults in the US that do not plan on getting vaccinated?

### Question 2b

---

Using the [Central Limit Theorem for proportions](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd#sec-clt-prop), estimate the standard error for the sampling distribution of sample proportions.

::: {.callout-tip}
To calculate the standard error, we need to know the population proportion $p$. Plug an appropriate sample statistic in place of $p$ to estimate the standard error.

#### Solution to Question 2b 

---


<br>  
<br>  
<br>  


### Question 2c

---

Next, we identify the value ($z_{\alpha/2}$ or $t_{\alpha/2}$) we multiply the standard error by to get the margin of error. For proportions, as long as the [the sample is large enough](#sec-samp-size), a normal distribution is an accurate model for the underlying sampling distribution. 

From the poll in [Question 1], we have $n=1227$. Since we do not know $p$, we substitute $\hat{p} = 0.3$ instead. Since both $n\hat{p} \geq 10$ and $n(1-\hat{p}) \geq 10$, we can **use a normal distribution to calculate the margin of error** for the confidence interval. 

What is the value of $z_{\alpha/2}$ for a 95% confidence interval for a proportion?

# Wald Confidence Interval for a Proportion

---

The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Wald confidence interval for a proportion**</span> is given by

$${\large \boxed{ \mbox{Wald:} \qquad {\color{tomato}{\hat{p}}} - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{{\color{tomato}{\hat{p}}}(1-{\color{tomato}{\hat{p}}})}{n}}  < p <  {\color{tomato}{\hat{p}}} + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{{\color{tomato}{\hat{p}}}(1-{\color{tomato}{\hat{p}}})}{n}}}}$$

We use the **plug-in principle** and <span style="color:tomato">use $\hat{p}$ for the unknown value of $p$</span> when calculating the standard error.

-   The advantage of this estimate is we can do it by hand.
-   The downside is that when we use $\hat{p}$ in place of $p$ we lose quite a bit of accuracy.

# Agresti-Coull Confidence Interval for a Proportion

---

When constructing a Wald confidence interval for a proportion, we use the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ as an estimator for $p$. The sample proportion is a very reasonable and intuitive point estimate. In addition, $\hat{p}$ is an **unbiased** estimator for $p$. However, there are many other estimators that could make sense to use in place of the parameter $p$, and there are other properties of estimators we should take into account. In particular, using a less precise estimator such as $\hat{p}$ results in a larger margin of error in the confidence interval compared to some other estimators.

When studying properties of estimators, we [considered another estimator for the parameter $p$](15-Properties-Estimators.qmd#sec-compare-prop), namely ${\color{tomato}{\tilde{p} = \frac{X+2}{n+4}}}$, where $X$ denotes the number of "successes". Comparing estimators $\hat{p}$ and $\tilde{p}$, we discovered that:

- The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is unbiased but less precise.
- The modified sample proportion ${\color{tomato}{\tilde{p}}}$ is **slightly biased but more precise**.
- The confidence interval using ${\color{tomato}{\tilde{p}}}$ will usually have a **smaller margin of error** than using $\hat{p}$.


The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Agresti-Coull confidence interval for a proportion**</span> is

$${\large \boxed{ \mbox{Agresti-Coull:} \qquad {\color{tomato}{\tilde{p}}} - z_{\alpha/2} \left( \sqrt{ \frac{{\color{tomato}{\tilde{p}}}(1-{\color{tomato}{\tilde{p}}})}{{\color{dodgerblue}{n+4}}}} \right) < p <  {\color{tomato}{\tilde{p}}} + z_{\alpha/2} \left( \sqrt{ \frac{{\color{tomato}{\tilde{p}}}(1-{\color{tomato}{\tilde{p}}})}{{\color{dodgerblue}{n+4}}}} \right)}}.$$


## Question 3

---

Using the same poll from [Question 1], find a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all adults in the US that do not plan to get vaccinated using the Agresti-Coull confidence interval for a proportion.

# Score Confidence Interval For a Proportion

---

From the [CLT for proportions](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd#sec-clt-prop), we have $\widehat{P} \sim N \left( \mu_{\widehat{P}} , \sigma_{\widehat{P}} \right) = N\left( p, \sqrt{\frac{ p (1-p)}{n}} \right)$. A standardized sample proportion has $z$-score $z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{ p (1-p)}{n}}}$. Thus, for confidence level $CL$, we have

$$P \left( -z_{\alpha/2} < \frac{\hat{p} -\color{tomato}{p}}{\sqrt{\frac{\color{tomato}{p}(1-\color{tomato}{p})}{n}}} < z_{\alpha/2} \right) =CL.$$

In the equation above, the <span style="color:tomato">unknown population parameter $p$ is in red</span>. All the other values ($\hat{p}$, $n$, and $z_{\alpha/2}$) in the formula are known values. Given a confidence level, we can algebraically solve for the cutoff values for ${\color{tomato}{p}}$ by solving the equations:


$$\dfrac{\hat{p} -{\color{tomato}{p}}}{\sqrt{\dfrac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p}})}{n}}} = z_{\alpha/2} \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad \dfrac{\hat{p} - {\color{tomato}{p}}}{\sqrt{\dfrac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p})}}{n}}} = -z_{\alpha/2}$$


## Score Confidence Interval Formulas

---

The confidence interval estimate resulting from the algebraic solution is called the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**score confidence interval for a proportion**</span>. The algebraic work involved in solving the equations above is provided in the [Appendix](#sec-score). The corresponding lower ($L$) and upper ($U$) cutoffs are:

$$\begin{aligned}
&L= \dfrac{\hat{p} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2n} - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \dfrac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}}}{1+ \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n}} \\
\\
&U= \dfrac{\hat{p} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2n} + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \dfrac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}}}{1+ \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n}}
\end{aligned}$$

- **Pro:** There is no additional uncertainty beyond the initial variability in sampling. 
- **Con:** The formulas are quite complicated. Calculating by hand is not really practical.
- Typically we use technology to calculate score confidence intervals.


## Score Confidence Intervals in R

---

R has a built in function `prop.test()$conf.int` that calculates a score confidence interval for a proportion.

- In R, use the command `prop.test(X, n, conf.level = CL, correct = FALSE)$conf.int`
  - $X$ denotes the number of "successes" observed in the sample.
  - $n$ denotes the total number of observations in the sample.
  - `CL` is a chosen confidence level (as a proportion).
  - The option `correct = FALSE` means no [continuity correction](#sec-score-corr) is applied.


## Question 4

---

Using the poll data in [Question 1], find a 95% score confidence interval for the proportion of all adults in the US that do not plan to get vaccinated by completing the `prop.test()` command in the code cell below.

### Solution to Question 4

---

```{r}
prop.test(??, ??, conf.level = ??, correct = FALSE)$conf.int
```

<br>  
<br>  

#### Checking Your Solution to Question 4 

---

Based on the polling sample data, enter the values for `X`, `n`, and `z.star` in the first code cell below. Then run the code cell. 

```{r}
##################################################
# Replace the ?? in the three lines of code below
# with appropriate values or commands
##################################################
X <- ??  # number of successes in sample (do not plan to get vax)
n <- ??  # sample size
z.star <- ??  # find z_alpha/2 for 95% confidence level
```


Next, run the code cell below to calculate the upper and lower cutoffs for a 95% score confidence interval for a proportion.


```{r}  
#########################################
# first run the code cell above
# nothing to edit in this code cell
# run as is
#########################################
phat <- X/n  # Compute sample proportion

# Computes Cutoffs for Score Confidence Interval
lower.score95 <- (phat+z.star^2/(2*n) - 
                z.star*sqrt( (phat*(1-phat))/n + z.star^2/(4*n^2) ) )/(1+z.star^2/n)
upper.score95 <- (phat+z.star^2/(2*n) + 
                z.star*sqrt( (phat*(1-phat))/n + z.star^2/(4*n^2) ) )/(1+z.star^2/n)

# Print cutoffs to screen
lower.score95
upper.score95
```

## Applying the Continuity Correction
 
---

In our construction of a score confidence interval, we have used a normal distribution to estimate a discrete (binomial) distribution. Recall when using a continuous, normal distribution to approximate a discrete, binomial distribution (as with the Central Limit Theorem for proportions), we miss some area under the curve resulting in an underestimate.  We can improve estimates resulting from using a normal distribution instead of a binomial distribution by
applying a [continuity correction](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop#sec-cont-corr). 

Similarly, we can obtain more a more accurate score confidence interval for a proportion by applying a continuity correction. The [Appendix explains how the continuity correction is applied](#sec-score-corr) and provides the corresponding formulas. In practice, we can simply change the `correct = FALSE` option in `prop.test()$conf.int` to `correct = TRUE`.

- `prop.test(X, n, conf.level = CL, correct = TRUE)$conf.int`
- The default for `prop.test` if no `correct` option is specified is `correct = TRUE`.
- <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Applying the continuity correction results in a more precise confidence interval.**</span>


### Applying the Continuity Correction in Code

---

Below we perform the direct calculations using the [continuity correction formulas derived in the Appendix](#sec-score-corr).

```{r}
##############################################
# Be sure you have run previous code cells
# And have already defined X, n, and z.star
# Run this code cell without any edits needed
##############################################

# Continuity corrections applied to sample proportion
cc.phat.L <- (X - 0.5)/n
cc.phat.U <- (X + 0.5)/n

# Plugged into formulas for Score Conf Interval
cc.lower <- (cc.phat.L + z.star^2/(2*n) - 
            z.star*sqrt( (cc.phat.L*(1-cc.phat.L))/n + z.star^2/(4*n^2) ) )/(1+z.star^2/n)
cc.upper <- (cc.phat.U + z.star^2/(2*n) + 
            z.star*sqrt( (cc.phat.U*(1-cc.phat.U))/n + z.star^2/(4*n^2) ) )/(1+z.star^2/n)

# Print results to screen to check
cc.lower
cc.upper
```

In the code cell below, we apply the continuity correction using the `correct = TRUE` option in `prop.test()` to compare with the previous result.

```{r}
prop.test(368, 1227, conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE)$conf.int
```

# A Difference in Two Proportions

---

## Central Limit Theorem for $\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2$

--- 

For a difference in two proportions, we can derive a Central Limit Theorem to model the sampling distribution for the difference in two sample proportions, $\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2$. See the [Appendix for a proof of the CLT for a difference in two proportions](#sec-clt-diffprop) which is stated below:

$$\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2  \sim N \left( \mu_{\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2} , \mbox{SE}(\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2) \right) = N \left( p_1 - p_2  , \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \right).$$


## Confidence Interval for $\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2$

---

We can modify the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Wald confidence interval**</span> to give an approximation for a confidence interval for a difference in two proportions

-   The <span style="color:dodgerblue">point estimate</span> is the difference in the two sample proportions, $\color{dodgerblue}{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}$.
-   The standard error we estimate by  <span style="color:mediumseagreen">plugging $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$ in place of $p_1$ and $p_2$</span> in the formula for the standard error from the Central Limit Theorem:

$$\mbox{SE} \left( \widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2 \right) = \sqrt{ \frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \approx \sqrt{ \frac{{\color{mediumseagreen}{\hat{p}_1}}(1-{\color{mediumseagreen}{\hat{p}_1}})}{n_1} + \frac{{\color{mediumseagreen}{\hat{p}_2}}(1-{\color{mediumseagreen}{\hat{p}_2}})}{n_2}}$$

- We **use the standard normal distribution** to identify $z_{\alpha/2}$ to find the <span style="color:tomato">margin of error</span>.

$$({\color{dodgerblue}{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}}) - {\color{tomato}{z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \dfrac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \dfrac{\hat{p}_2 (1-\hat{p}_2) }{n_2}}}}  < p_1-p_2 < ({\color{dodgerblue}{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}}) + {\color{tomato}{z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \dfrac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \dfrac{\hat{p}_2 (1-\hat{p}_2) }{n_2}}}}.$$

We use Wald confidence intervals for a difference in two proportions, but be aware there are other variations of confidence intervals for a difference in two proportions, similar to the Agresti-Coull and score confidence intervals.  In R, the command 

<center>`prop.test(c(x1, x2), c(n1, n2), conf.level = CL, correct = TRUE)$conf.int` </center>

<br> 
computes a **Wald confidence interval** for a difference in two proportions with a continuity correction applied.


::: {.callout-note}
In R, the `prop.test()` function uses different methods depending on whether the confidence interval is for a single proportion or a difference in two proportions.

- For a single proportion, `prop.test()` gives a score confidence interval.
- For a difference in two proportions, `prop.test()` gives a Wald confidence interval.

## A Note About Sample Sizes {#sec-samp-size}


---

- For a **single mean**, we can use the CTL to construct a parametric confidence interval as long as:

  - Either the population is symmetric or $n \geq 30$.
  - If the sample is symmetric, we can assume the population is symmetric. 

- For a **difference in two means** , we can use the CTL to construct a parametric confidence interval as long as:

  - Population 1 is either symmetric or $n_1 \geq 30$, and 
  - Population 2 is either symmetric or $n_2 \geq 30$.

- For a **single proportion**, we can use the CTL to construct a parametric confidence interval as long as:

  - Both $n\hat{p} \geq 10$ and $n(1-\hat{p}) \geq 10$.

- For a **difference in two proportions**, we can use the CTL to construct a parametric confidence interval as long as:

  - All of $n_1\hat{p}_1 \geq 10$,  $n_1(1-\hat{p}_1) \geq 10$,  $n_2\hat{p}_2 \geq 10$, and $n_2(1-\hat{p}_2) \geq 10$ are satisfied.

## Useful R Functions

---

In R, we have the functions:

- `t.test()$conf.int` constructs a $t$-confidence interval for a single or difference in two means.
- `prop.test()$conf.int` constructs a score confidence interval for a single proportion.
- `prop.test()$conf.int` constructs a Wald confidence interval for a difference in two proportions.

Let $X \sim \mbox{Binom}(n,p)$ and consider the distribution of sample proportions, $\widehat{P} = \frac{X}{n}$. From the [CLT for proportions](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd#sec-clt-prop) we know $\widehat{P} \sim N \left( p, \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \right)$. Thus, for confidence level CL, we have

$$P(-z_{\alpha/2}< Z < z_{\alpha/2}) = P \left( -z_{\alpha/2} < \frac{\hat{p} -{\color{tomato}{p}}}{\sqrt{\frac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p}})}{n}}} < z_{\alpha/2} \right) =CL.$$

The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**upper cutoff, $U$**</span> is a value for ${\color{tomato}{p}}$ such that

$$\dfrac{\hat{p} -{\color{tomato}{p}}}{\sqrt{\dfrac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p}})}{n}}} = z_{\alpha/2}.$$

To solve for ${\color{tomato}{p}}$, we multiply both sides of the equation above by $\sqrt{\dfrac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p}})}{n}}$ and then square both sides giving

$$\big( \hat{p} - {\color{tomato}{p}} \big)^2 = (z_{\alpha/2})^2 \left( \frac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p}})}{n} \right).$$

Next we distribute terms on both sides of the equation and have

$$\hat{p}^2 - 2 {\color{tomato}{p}}\hat{p} + {\color{tomato}{p}}^2 = {\color{tomato}{p}} \left( \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n} \right) - {\color{tomato}{p}}^2 \left( \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n} \right).$$

We have a quadratic equation for the unknown ${\color{tomato}{p}}$. We group all like terms together on one side of the equation,


$${\color{dodgerblue}{\left( 1+ \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n} \right)}} p^2 + {\color{tomato}{\left(-2\hat{p}-\frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n} \right)}} p + {\color{mediumseagreen}{\hat{p}^2}} = {\color{dodgerblue}{a}}p^2 + {\color{tomato}{b}} p + {\color{mediumseagreen}{c}} = 0.$$
We use the quadratic formula to solve for $p$. The quadratic equation has two real solutions, the larger of the two solution is the upper limit for a 95% score confidence interval

$${\large \boxed{ U = \frac{ \hat{p} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2n} + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \dfrac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}}}{1+\dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n}}}}$$

The smaller of the two solutions is the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**lower cutoff, $L$**</span>

$${\large \boxed{ L = \frac{ \hat{p} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2n} - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \dfrac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}}}{1+\dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n}}}}$$

We also consider the equation

$$\dfrac{\hat{p} -{\color{tomato}{p}}}{\sqrt{\dfrac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p}})}{n}}} = -z_{\alpha/2}.$$

If we multiply both sides of the equation above by $\sqrt{\dfrac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p}})}{n}}$ and then square both sides, we get

$$\big( \hat{p} - {\color{tomato}{p}} \big)^2 = (-z_{\alpha/2})^2 \left( \frac{{\color{tomato}{p}}(1-{\color{tomato}{p}})}{n} \right).$$

The resulting equation is the same as with the first case we solved. Thus, solving the equation above gives the same expressions for $U$ and $L$.


## Applying a Continuity Correction {#sec-score-corr}

---

Recall, when using a normal distribution to approximate a discrete, binomial distribution $X \sim \mbox{Binom}(n,p)$, we can improve the estimate by using a [continuity correction](11-Sampling-Dist-Prop.qmd#sec-cont-corr).

In the case of a score confidence interval for a proportion, the continuity correction is applied as follows:

-   In the formula for the corrected lower cutoff $L^*$, we use the corrected sample proportion ${\color{dodgerblue}{\hat{p}_L^*= \dfrac{X-0.5}{n}}}$.
-   In the formula for the corrected upper cutoff $U^*$, we use the corrected sample proportion ${\color{tomato}{\hat{p}_U^* = \dfrac{X+0.5}{n}}}$.

$$\begin{aligned}
&L^* = \dfrac{{\color{dodgerblue}{\hat{p}_L^*}} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2n} - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \dfrac{{\color{dodgerblue}{\hat{p}_L^*}}(1-{\color{dodgerblue}{\hat{p}_L^*}})}{n} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}}}{1+ \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n}} \\
\\
&U^* = \dfrac{{\color{tomato}{\hat{p}_U^*}} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2n} + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ \dfrac{{\color{tomato}{\hat{p}_U^*}}(1-{\color{tomato}{\hat{p}_U^*}})}{n} + \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}}}{1+ \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n}}
\end{aligned}$$


## CLT: Difference in Two Proportions {#sec-clt-diffprop}

---


Let $X_1 \sim \mbox{Binom}(n_1,p_1)$ and $X_2 \sim \mbox{Binom}(n_2,p_2)$ be two independent binomial random variables with distribution of sample proportions $\widehat{P}_1 = \frac{X_1}{n_1}$ and $\widehat{P}_2 = \frac{X_2}{n_2}$, respectively. As long as [both samples are large enough](#sec-samp-size), the sampling distribution for the difference in sample proportions $\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}$ will:

-   Be approximately <span style="color:dodgerblue">**normally distributed**</span>.
-   Have mean ${\color{dodgerblue}{E(\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) = \mu_{\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2} =p_1 - p_2}}$.
-   Have <span style="color:dodgerblue">**standard error**</span> 
$${\color{dodgerblue}{\mbox{SE}(\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2) =  \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}}}.$$

We summarize the results of the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for a Difference in Two Proportions**</span> more concisely below:

$${\color{dodgerblue}{\boxed{ \widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2  \sim N \left( \mu_{\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2} , \mbox{SE}(\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2) \right) = N \left( p_1 - p_2  , \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \right)}}}.$$

### Proof of CLT for Difference in Two Proportions

---

Below we prove both $E(\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) = \mu_{\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2} =p_1 - p_2$ and $\mbox{SE}(\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2) =  \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$. 


#### Mean of Sampling Distribution for $\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2$

---

We have $E (\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) = E \left( \frac{X_1}{n_1} -\frac{X_2}{n_2} \right)$. Using [properties of expected value](06-Expected-Value-and-Variance.qmd#sec-prop-exp), we have

$$E (\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) = E \left( \frac{X_1}{n_1} -\frac{X_2}{n_2} \right) = \frac{1}{n_1} E(X_1) - \frac{1}{n_2} E(X_2).$$

Since $X_1 \sim \mbox{Binom}(n_1,p_1)$ and $X_2 \sim \mbox{Binom}(n_2,p_2)$, we know ${\color{dodgerblue}{E(X_1) = n_1p_1}}$ and ${\color{tomato}{E(X_2) = n_2p_2}}$. Thus we have

$$E (\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) = \frac{1}{n_1} {\color{dodgerblue}{n_1p_1}} - \frac{1}{n_2} {\color{tomato}{n_2p_2}}=p_1-p_2.$$

This concludes the proof that $E (\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) =p_1-p_2$.


#### Standard Error of Sampling Distribution for $\widehat{P}_1 - \widehat{P}_2$

---

We have $\mbox{Var} (\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) = \mbox{Var} \left( \frac{X_1}{n_1} -\frac{X_2}{n_2} \right)$. $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent random variables, so we can use [properties of variance](06-Expected-Value-and-Variance.qmd#sec-prop-var):

$$\mbox{Var} \left( \frac{X_1}{n_1} -\frac{X_2}{n_2} \right) = \left(\frac{1}{n_1}\right)^2 \mbox{Var}(X_1) + \left(- \frac{1}{n_2} \right)^2 \mbox{Var}(X_2) = \frac{1}{n_1^2}\mbox{Var}(X_1) + \frac{1}{n_2^2}\mbox{Var}(X_2).$$

Since $X_1 \sim \mbox{Binom}(n_1,p_1)$ and $X_2 \sim \mbox{Binom}(n_2,p_2)$, we know ${\color{dodgerblue}{\mbox{Var}(X_1) = n_1p_1(1-p_1)}}$ and ${\color{tomato}{\mbox{Var}(X_2) = n_2p_2(1-p_2)}}$. Thus we have

$$\mbox{Var} (\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) = \frac{1}{n_1^2} {\color{dodgerblue}{n_1p_1(1-p_1)}} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} {\color{tomato}{n_2p_2(1-p_2)}}= \frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}.$$

The standard error of the sampling distribution is the square root of the variance, thus we have

$$\mbox{SE} (\widehat{P_1}-\widehat{P_2}) = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}.$$
