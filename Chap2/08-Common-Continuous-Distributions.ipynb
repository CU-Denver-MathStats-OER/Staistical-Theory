    "used to screen for whether a person is malnourished, healthy, or\n",

    "\n",
    "> Israel became the first country ever to pass legislation banning the\n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard normal distribution tables were very useful prior to spread\n",

    "need to use tables to get approximations. Instead, we can use R\n",
    "functions to compute these areas more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to binomial, geometric, and Poisson distributions, R has built\n",
    "in functions to perform calculations with normal distributions. In\n",
    "particular, the function `pnorm()` calculates values of the cumulative\n",
    "distribution function for a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `pnorm(x, mean, sd)`$=P(X<x)$ gives the area to the left of $x$\n",
    "    under $N(\\mu,\\sigma)$.\n",
    "-   `pnorm(x, mean,  sd, lower.tail=FALSE)`$=P(X>x)$ gives the area to\n",
    "    the right of $x$ under $N(\\mu,\\sigma)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can find the $z$-score and use the standard normal distribution\n",
    "in R as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `pnorm(z, 0, 1)`$=P(Z<z)$ gives the area to the left of $x$ under\n",
    "    $N(0,1)$.\n",
    "-   `pnorm(z, 0,  1, lower.tail=FALSE)`$=P(Z>z)$ gives the area to the\n",
    "    right of $x$ under $N(0,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use the function `dnorm(x, mean, sd)` to compute probabilities\n",
    "related to normal distribution since `dnorm()` returns the height of the\n",
    "probability density function. For continuous random variables,\n",
