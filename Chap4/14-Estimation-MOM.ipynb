        "Estimation is generally the process of predicting the value(s) of unknown population parameters using data collected from a sample. There are different statistical methods that can be applied to a data set to reach the same ultimate goal, such as finding an accurate estimate for a parameter. We explored the method of [maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)](13-Estimation-MLE.qmd). With MLE estimation, we find the most likely value of a parameter, $\\theta$. We find the value for $\\theta$ that maximizes a likelihood function that gives the probability of randomly selecting the observed sample data.\n",

        "We now explore another estimation method called the <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**method of moments**</span> (commonly abbreviated as <span style=\"color:dodgerblue\">**MoM**</span>). Both MLE and MoM and estimates are used to answer the same question, what is the value of an unknown population parameter, $\\theta$? MoM estimates approach the question following a different objective then MLE. We find the values for the population parameters such that certain properties of the population (for example $\\mu_X=E(X)$ and $\\sigma^2_X = \\mbox{Var}(X)$) are equal to the corresponding statistics (such as the sample mean, $\\bar{x}$, and sample variance, $s^2$) that we calculate from a randomly selected sample.\n",
