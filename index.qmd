# Preface {.unnumbered}

---

*Statistical Methods: Exploring the Uncertain* is a set of course materials for an undergraduate course (typically junior year) in statistics that is required for our math majors. The course is designed as a full semester course and topics covered include exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, probability, estimation, resampling methods, and hypothesis tests.


## Intended Audience

---

These activities are developed for MATH 3382 - Statistical Theory at University of Colorado Denver. The course is required for Math/Stat majors. Students typically have completed a course in multivariate calculus. Familiarity with linear algebra, programming, and/or probability are not required.

## How to Access these Materials

---

The intention is to balance simplicity in Markdown and R code with the formatting and aesthetic features.

- By clicking the `Render` button or `Build Book` button on the toolbar above, you should get a nice looking, static html document without needing any further software (LaTeX in not required when rendering to html). This materials are intended to be interactive. Edit them as you like.

- The Markdown text hopefully is easy to follow and edit.
- The R Code is intended to be interactive.
  - Change plotting options, labels, colors.
  - Replace the examples/data with your own.
